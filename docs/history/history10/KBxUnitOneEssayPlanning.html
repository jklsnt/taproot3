    silver from the New World (see Environ- ment and Technology: Metal
    Currency and Inflation), affectedmany of the remaining landholders,

    theirpurchasing power decline so much that they could notreport for

    metal poured into Spain from silver and gold mines in the New World,
    but there was no increase in the availability of goods and services.
    The resulting infla-tion triggered a "price revolut ion" in Europe-a
    gen- eral tripling of prices between 1500 and 1650. In Paris in 1650
    the price of wheat and hay was fifteen times higher than the price
    had been in 1500. </span><em><span>Bulliet, 494</span></em></p></li><li><p><span>As a result, the country faced the unsolvable problem of finding

    the warlords and tame the aristocracies that had provided services
    to the crown by building armies and bureaucracies loyal to the
    central government alone. Building these armies and bureaucracies
    was expensive, and soldiers and bureaucrats had to be paid.

make war" (Systems and States, 10). He lays out a theory of state
making, claiming that a state has four primary functions: war making,
protection, extraction, and of course, state making. Simply put, war
making stems from the need to protect a territory, which then leads to
extraction, protection, and state making. Tilly leaves out the obvious,
which is that failure to achieve one of these functions would lead to a
crash. War making does not lead to state making if one loses the war.
{diagram} Tilly dubbed this idea "Bellicist Theory," bellicist meaning
one who advocates for war. However, the error in this theory is in the
namesake itself. Tilly overgeneralizes{wc}, ignoring many other causes
that lead to state making in the same way that war making does. To amend
this, 'need' should be in place of war making. {diagram} For war making,
this need would be the need for protection against an enemy army, or the
need for resources as acquired through war making. Throughout the course
of this essay, I will examine places in which this amended Bellicist
theory functions and normal Bellicist theory does not.</span></p><p><span>The Bellicist theory remains consistent when war making is replaced with
plague, a biological attack. Effective mitigation of plague requires a
level of organization higher than a single person can achieve. Instead,
it requires protection as provided by the state, perhaps taking the form
of sanitation mandates or information as opposed to the formation of an
army. This protection would require extraction, which, with the same
logic as originally applied with war making, would lead to state making.
An example of this occurrence--in the negative--can be found in the late
1500s during the fall of the Ottoman empire. Kennedy reports,
"Contemptuous of European ideas and practices, the Turks declined to
adopt newer methods for containing plagues;" (citation). Due to this
lack of new method adoption, the Ottomans did not follow the modified
Bellicist theory {wc}, and hence, "suffered more from severe epidemics"
(citation). Instead, the Ottomans opted for methods such as destroying
state observatories, "alleging that it had caused a plague" (citation).
This failure to achieve the primary functions of the state, as described
by Tilly, ultimately aided in the downfall of the Ottoman Empire.</span></p><p><span>Just like physical attack and biological attack, income attack{wc,
intent?} also leads to state making. Income attack can manifest in many
ways, one of which is inflation. When inflation occurred{tense?}, many
countries whose "soldiers and bureaucrats had to be paid," "faced the
unsolvable problem of finding money to pay the army and
bureaucracy"(Citation, gelvin, bulliet). During the late sixteenth
century, a flood of silver from Spain caused massive inflation, leading
to the problem described above. This event has been dubbed the "price
revolution[, with] a general tripling of prices between 1500 and
1650"(citation bulliet). This price revolution forced the Ottoman Empire
to implement "emergency taxes," or, in other words, extraction
(citation). In the Ottoman Empire, this inflation was so extreme that
soldiers, peasants, bureaucrats, "and even impoverished students of
religion formed bands of marauders"(citation bulliet). These marauders
turned to internal plundering, and, expectedly, the government attempted
to eliminate them. This process lines up exactly with Tilly's precise
definition of state making: "The act of eliminating internal rival
forces and insurgents from within its own territories" (citation). This
elimination was of course an act of protection, and thus, it can be seen
that income attack can be a replacement for war making while keeping
Bellicist theory consistent.</span></p><p><span>A final example is ideological attack. A way states control their people
is through a shared, commonly theological, ideology. When a competing
ideology is introduced, this threatens the state's control, and thus,
the state attempts to crush them. This process is seen time and time
again throughout history, but perhaps one of the most notable examples
is the Protestant Reformation. In the early 1500s, Catholicism was
threatened by a new ideology, Protestantism. This ideological threat
"had an enormous and immediate impact upon politics," and the state
quickly decided to "pit[...] Catholics against Protestants"
(citation)(citation). This ideological threat led to the state
attempting to eliminate rivals within its territory, which, again, is
Tilly's precise definition of state making. The original threat was not
physical; there was no army the state had to protect itself against, and
yet, the process laid out in Bellicist theory still occurred. ##

make war" (Systems and States 10). He lays out his theory of state
making, claiming that a state has four primary functions: war making,
protection, extraction, and of course, state making. Simply put, war
making stems from the need to protect a territory, which then leads to
the other three functions. Tilly leaves out the obvious, which is that
failure to achieve one of these functions would lead to a crash. War
making does not lead to state making if one loses the war. {diagram}
Tilly dubbed this idea "Bellicist Theory," bellicist meaning one who
advocates for war. However, the limits of this theory are in its name
itself. While incredibly insightful, Tilly takes an overly narrow view,
implying that war making is the only cause that leads to state making.
This viewpoint ignores many other causes. Replacing 'war making' with
'address need' appropriately amends this model. {diagram} For war
making, this need would be the need for protection against an enemy
army, or the need for resources as acquired through war making.
Throughout the course of this essay, I will examine places in which this
amended Bellicist theory applies to the historical record while normal
Bellicist theory does not. When war making is replaced with plague, the
underlying ideas in the Bellicist theory remain valid. Effective
mitigation of contagious disease requires a level of organization beyond
that which a single person can achieve. Instead, it requires protection
as provided by the state, perhaps taking the form of sanitation mandates
or information as opposed to the formation of an army. This protection
would require extraction, which, with the same logic as originally
applied with war making, would lead to state making. The fall of the
Ottoman empire in the late 1500s demonstrates the explanatory power of
the amended Bellicist theory---in the negative. Kennedy reports,
"Contemptuous of European ideas and practices, the Turks declined to
adopt newer methods for containing plagues." By "declin[ing] to adopt
newer methods," the Ottomans failed to follow the amended Bellicist
theory, and hence, "suffered more from severe epidemics." They failed to
address the need. Instead, the Ottomans opted for methods such as
destroying state observatories, "alleging that it had caused a plague"
(Kennedy 12). This failure to achieve the primary functions of the state
ultimately contributed to the downfall of the Ottoman Empire. Much like
physical attack and biological attack, income attack can also lead to
state making. Income attack can manifest in many ways, one of which is
inflation. During the late sixteenth century, a flood of silver from
Spain caused massive inflation. With the currency devalued, many
countries whose "soldiers and bureaucrats had to be paid," faced "the
unsolvable problem of finding money to pay the army and bureaucracy"
(Gelvin 33-34, Bulliet 500). This event has been dubbed the "price
revolution[, with] a general tripling of prices between 1500 and 1650"
(Bulliet 494). The price revolution forced the Ottoman Empire to
implement "emergency taxes," or, in Tilly's terminology, extraction. In
the Ottoman Empire, this inflation was so extreme that soldiers,
peasants, bureaucrats, "and even impoverished students of religion
formed bands of marauders" (Bulliet 491). These marauders turned to
internal plundering, and, as might be expected, the government attempted
to eliminate them. This process lines up exactly with Tilly's precise
definition of state making: "The act of eliminating internal rival
forces and insurgents from within its own territories" (Systems and
States 11). This elimination was of course an act of protection. Thus,
it can be seen that the effects of an income attack can map to war
making in the amended Bellicist theory. A final example of a limitation
in Tilly's Bellicist theory---that is addressed by the amended Bellicist
theory---is the ideological attack. One way states control their people
is through a shared, typically theological, ideology. When a competing
ideology is introduced, this threatens the state's control. Consistent
with the amended Bellicist theory, the state attempts to crush them.
This process is seen time and time again throughout history, but perhaps
one of the most notable examples is the Protestant Reformation. In the
early 1500s, Catholicism was threatened by a new ideology,
Protestantism. This ideological threat "had an enormous and immediate
impact upon politics," and the state quickly decided to "pit[...]
Catholics against Protestants" (McNeil 310, Roberts 45). This
ideological threat led to the state attempting to eliminate rivals
within its territory, which, again, is Tilly's precise definition of
state making. The original threat was not physical; there was no army
the state had to protect itself against. Tilly's theory does not address
ideological attack, and yet the process laid out in Bellicist theory
still occurred.\\
Tilly's theory is deeply insightful, and has phenomenal explanatory
power. But, in its efforts to explain the relationship of war making to
other state functions, it limits its focus. War making, influential as
it is, is a special case of a broader phenomenon. By amending Tilly's
theory and replacing war making with 'address need,' Tilly's insights
can be preserved and expanded. We have shown several examples where
amended Bellicist theory applies and Bellicist theory does not,
including plague, inflation, and ideological attack. Of course, these
are only a select few cases where amended Bellicist theory can be
applied. Powerful theories often start small, and are expanded over time
as their true capability is discovered. This theory may be such a case.</span></p><p><span>Works Cited:</span></p><p><span>"The Rise of the Western World." The Rise and Fall of the Great Powers:
