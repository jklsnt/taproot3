period, Mercantilism dominated. Ideologically speaking, the jump from
Mercantilism to free market is quite a large one, so what allowed this
shift? Why was it that free market economies dominate now and not then?
The answer lies in a misconception rooted deep inside the concept of
Mercantilism: wealth is zero sum. This misconception was what prevented
free market systems from dominating.</span></p><p><span>To truly understand this misconception and its impact on the world, we
first must understand the system in which it took place. In the wake of
Europes' fragmentation, a balance of power was created through raison
d'etat. The concept of raison d'etat states that the "well-being of the
state justified whatever means were employed to further it"(citation).
In other words, states should act only for their own personal gains
without regarding the barriers of morality. A set of states all
performing raison d'etat leads to a balance of power. Power was no
longer controlled --- or attempted to be controlled --- through policy,
but rather through the emergent property of "shifting international
alliances that prevented any one country from becoming too
powerful"(citation). The transition between raison d'etat to a balance
of power manifested in multiple ways. One of these ways was war marking,
as when "any state threatened to become dominant, its neighbors formed a
coalition not in pursuit of a theory of international relations but out
of pure self-interest to block the ambitions of the most
powerful"(citation). War, arising out of pure self interest, led to
groups of states maintaining the balance of power while having no regard
for the greater good. Economically speaking, raison d'etat manifested in
Mercantilism --- a theory which guided economic policy and "held that
the wealth of a nation could best be enhanced by the accumulation of
precious metals like silver and gold"(citation). War, while prominent,
was not what drove policy that effected virtually everybody's days to
day life; economic theory, on the other hand, did.</span></p><p><span>Mercantilism, this economic theory, is reliant on a fundamentally flawed
assumption. The core of this theory is about placing "emphasis on
precious metals and government regulation" in an attempt to maximize
exports while minimizing imports (citation). Mercantilists viewed
imports as flow of wealth to rivals, and thus, the empowerment of
rivals. Reversedly, exports leading to an intake of precious metals were
viewed as an increase in power. Any import meant power to rivals and
weakening of the state, and vise versa; thus, raison d'etat leads the
state to do everything in its power to minimize its imports and maximize
its exports. However, Mercantilism, while fundamentally being about
wealth, confuses wealth with precious metals. The state is not simply
trying to increase its intake of precious metals, but using this intake
as a proxy for wealth. This is a flawed proxy. Precious metals are
simply another commodity, and do not truly translate to wealth. By
understanding that precious metals are a flawed proxy, the true
misconception in Mercantilism is revealed: wealth is a zero sum game.
Intuitively, wealth being zero sum makes sense. I give a slice of my pie
to a rival, I lose a slice of my pie. The overall amount of pie is still
constant. This pie model seems almost unquestionable when applied to
precious metals --- I trade away some gold, I lose some gold and my
rival gains some gold. The overall amount of gold is still constant.
This same scenario, however, does not apply with wealth. Of course,
overall quantity of precious metals cannot be changed through trade, but
wealth can. The fundamental assumption that Mercantilism is based upon
is entirely flawed. Wealth not being zero sum was what, in part, allowed
"alternative economic theories, such as Adam Smith's theory of a free
market economy" to dominate (citation).</span></p><p><span>Free market systems, unlike what is assumed by Mercantilism, can
generate wealth through trade. With a free market system, your rival's
gain was not necessarily your loss --- trade was clearly not zero sum.
By disattaching precious metals from wealth, it can be understood that
wealth is heavily tied to resource allocation, something that is best
done by the emergent properties of a free market. With proper or
improper resource allocation the overall wealth of the world can be,
respectively, gained or lost. Adam Smith evidences this concept with an
example, writing that "it is the maxim of every prudent master of a
family, never to attempt to make at home what it will cost him more to
make than to buy"(citation). If the "master of the family" was not so
prudent and did attempt to make at home what it costed him less to buy,
then he would be improperly allocating his resources and losing wealth
without giving an equal amount of wealth. Thus, the overall amount of
wealth in the world would have decreased. To illustrate this concept
with a more specific scenario, imagine a room full of young students. At
lunch time, the door closes, and the students proceed to trade. The
students who wish to trade do so, and the ones who don't do not. By the
end of lunch, the the students emerge with more value --- more </span><em><span>wealth</span></em><span>
--- than before lunch, despite the fact that the classroom doors
remained closed the entire time. This scenario is of course a microcosm
of this {concept?}, where wealth was added to the world through the
resource allocation done by the free market. This ability for free
markets to generate wealth was what, {in part}, "shattered the prevalent
doctrines of protectionism and mercantilism and became the basis for
what would develop into capitalism"(citation).</span></p></section></div></div></div></div></article><div class="metapanel"><div class="metalabel">Contents</div><ol><li><a href="#unit-two-essay">Unit.
