It
brought the invention of railroads, steamboats, and the telegraph, which
"rapidly became as conventional a presence in the nineteenth century as
the cell phone is today" (Gelvin 80). These inventions allowed for the
rapid travel of goods and information the likes of which had never been
seen before. The Industrial Revolution led to a sort of co-revolution
which continues to this day: the interconnectivity revolution.
Interconnectivity, in this context, can be defined as the exchange of
goods and ideas and the infrastructure facilitating this exchange. All
of a sudden, the world was becoming massively interconnected, not only
dramatically increasing the pool of ideas that any given state had
access to, but exponentially increasing the ways these ideas could
interact with one another. As a consequence, the 19th century was
fraught with massive changes in power. The major factor that determined
which side of the power shift a state would be on was its willingness to
embrace interconnectivity.</span></p><p><span>Britain heavily embraced interconnectivity, leveraging it for power and
profit. Trade, one of Britain's main sources of income, is one of the
primary manifestations of interconnectivity. Britain heavily promoted
trade, even leveraging its power to take territory from other states,
creating "important commercial and trading centers" (Mason 98). They
focused on developing a powerful navy, which became "the largest in the
world" (Kennedy 152). This navy effectively served as an infrastructure
for propagating interconnectivity, as seafaring was the primary means of
transferring goods and ideas between states. They used this navy to
enforce free trade and manage trade routes, further promoting
interconnectivity and eventually leading to the "spectacular growth of
an integrated global economy [...] and financial network centered [...]
upon Great Britain" (Kennedy 143). Of course, Britain benefited
massively off of this newly created integrated financial network, which,
along with it's goods, would spread ideas. Expanding and rising in power
immensely, Britain truly was one of the driving forces behind this
interconnectivity revolution.</span></p><p><span>After centuries of isolation, Japan accepted the interconnectivity
revolution and prospered because of it. During Japan's period of self
isolation, "no Japanese was allowed to leave the islands or even to
build a ship large enough to navigate the high seas. No foreigner [...]
was allowed to enter" (Palmer 543). Japan had little power, little
influence, and was the antithesis of an interconnected state. This
isolation continued until 1853, when "the American Commodore Perry
forced his way with a fleet of naval vessels into Yedo Bay," initiating
Japan into the interconnectivity revolution (Palmer 543). Commodore
Perry demanded that the Japanese engage in trade with the Western
powers, and "the Japanese began to comply [...] in 1867 an internal
revolution took place, of which the most conspicuous consequence was a
rapid westernizing of Japanese life and institutions" (Palmer 543). In
what is now called the Meiji era, spanning from 1868 to 1912, Japan
experienced a complete shift from isolation to being the model of a
modern state. Trade, "almost literally zero in 1854, was valued at $200
million a year by the end of the century" (Palmer 548). Japan embraced
interconnectivity, exchanging and adopting ideas along with goods. This
exchange led to a massive increase in Japan's power, and they formed a
"newly westernized army and navy" which was "modeled on the British"
(Palmer 547). This increase in power allowed Japan to defeat the
Russians and the Chinese, much "to the world's amazement" (Palmer 654).
Japan, beginning as the very opposite of an interconnected state,
accepted interconnectivity, and rapidly gained the ideas and goods which
ultimately led to a massive increase in their power.</span></p><p><span>China, starting with isolation similar to Japan's, resisted the
interconnectivity revolution and suffered because of it. Initially,
China resisted free trade. They saw trade itself as a sort of charity, a
privilege "granted to less-developed 'barbarians' in exchange for their
paying respects to the Son of Heaven and his court" (Ropp 102). They
also heavily restricted trade, allowing it only in specific ports and
confining traders to but "a few warehouses [...] to reside only
temporarily to load and unload their ships." (Ropp 102). This outlook on
trade --- and the policy that followed --- led to the inevitable and
increasing frustration of the British traders. Not only did China resist
the exchange of goods, but they also resisted the exchange of ideas ---
two key components in interconnectivity. In 1898, "a brilliant Confucian
scholar who admired Japan for its rapid adoption of Western institutions
and industrialization" tried to do the same to China (Ropp 110). He
issued a myriad of edicts, all based upon the idea of sending China
through a "crash program of industrialization and Westernization" (Ropp
110). Conservatives grew alarmed, and the reform movement was easily and
soundly crushed. Interconnectivity inherently brings with it a loss in
autonomy and tradition, and China's unwillingness to sacrifice these led
to it's downfall. Of course, Britain eventually released their navy upon
China. Unlike the Japanese who embraced the interconnectivity revolution
and built a powerful military, "the Chinese had no naval forces" and
were almost instantly defeated (Ropp 105). The British mandated free
trade by force, and China massively decreased in power. China was now an
unwilling part of the interconnectivity revolution.</span></p><p><span>Not only does interconnectivity allows for broader access to ideas and
goods, but it allows for new ideas to be created that would otherwise be
impossible. The power of the interconnectivity revolution was greater
than any state, and acceptance of this historical trend was required for
success. The interconnectivity revolution has only continued, the world
still shrinking day by day. In modern times --- with the invention of
the internet and such --- it is much easier to see the value of
interconnectivity, making refuting its importance almost futile.
Sometimes we must sacrifice in the face of global trends</span></p><p><span>interconnectivity is more important and evident in modern day</span></p><p><span>Works Cited:</span></p><p><span>Palmer, R R, Joel Colton, and Lloyd S. Kramer. </span><em><span>A History of the Modern
