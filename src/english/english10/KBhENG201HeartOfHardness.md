[Alexa and Nueva folks, the Slides.](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1a9mxL5Pot8sbcIYP1mLiFqhQrYEOa60eIyHp3ftTLGo)

Ok. Now that that's out of the way, let's deal with this "Bloody Racist" book. To understand this work fully, one must understand Congo, its govermental systems, and the Scramble for Africa (Africa's cakeification by Europeans).

## Critical Theory
An approach to contentualize a text + see through to something. Think: "a feminist lens" — Critical Race Theory, Queer Theory, Maxist Theory, Feminist Theory, Post-Colonial Theory, Colonial Theory, Cultral Studies, etc. etc.

And, here's the rub: **History is Written by the Victors** — an important part of the analysis of the _Heart of Darkness_ is to recognize its story in a Colonial Lens.

[The Various Lit Theories](https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/subject_specific_writing/writing_in_literature/literary_theory_and_schools_of_criticism/)

### Colonial Theory
* View through the Colonizer
* "Written by the victors"

## Reflections
[[KBhENG201Page0t17]]
[[KBe20eng201part1]]

## Why are we reading it?
For answers to the essential question, of course! [[KBhENG201AlexaD1]]

* How do literature, language, and storytelling both perpetuate and dismantle the tools of the colonizer?  
    * Could be a text that attempts to dismatle racism => "loot at the damage that Europeans did"
    * Could be a text that attempts to propergate racism 
* How does colonialism shift notions of race, equity, socio-economic status, natural resources, religion for the colonizer, colonized, and the reader? 

## Objectives
**Central to Know**

* Basics of plot and character development
* Conrad's style and key lit devices
* History of colonialism in Africa

* King Leopold took "Ethiopia", and sectioned it off 
* Spain and Portugal agreement => "spain has Americas, protugal has africa"

**Important to Know**

* Engagement with Essential Questions
* Conrad's background

**Nice to Know**

* Modernism + Heart of Darkness's relationship to lit history

***

**“The sunken eyes looked up … vacant … a kind of blind, white flicker in the depths of the orbs, which died out slowly. … I found nothing else … but to offer him … biscuits. The fingers closed slowly on it and held — there was no other movement and no other glance.”**

"Deadness in the eyes" => {the soul, the witness, sense, knowledge} => "the fool is blind"

* His eyes => the sunken eyes
* His fingers => the fingers

Ambiguity and dehumanization of fingers

* Frequent talk about the feature
* No descriptions as a whole
* Description of the _non-black_ parts of the body only
    * Notices and grapples with the darkness
    * "White Eyes, Hands, etc" => notices the whiteness
    * Dehumanization
    
* Porchugal invented a faster boat
* Brits and Franchies and Dutch had more nefarious goal
