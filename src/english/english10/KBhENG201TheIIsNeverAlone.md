# The I is Never Alone, Reflection

## Initial Reaction
* Tragic, hey?
* Examining national identity + colonialism
* So, what's up with the birds?
    * Birds taken on human behaviors
    * Similar to Wild Animal Imprinting!!

## Thoughts on Composition
Thoughts on the composition of the text...

- Crappy stuff happening to Siriak – but very often at dawn or dusk… #why?
    - "Died together before sunset"
    - "At down he set food on the isle"
- Shift in tone and pride: 
    - "**Condemned**" => Walking about
        - (Also, Condemned used a lot!) 
        - Perhaps a demonstration of the involuntary nature of events?
    - "Stared at + pronounced" => Proclaimed
- "Bones mixed with the sand on the beach"
    - So, he _became_ part of the island?
    - Assimilation or giving in?
- "The outcome was everything Siriak might have hoped for, if not forseen"  — so, in some ways, is Siriak loosing track of his larger "mission"
- Symbolism of mirrors
    - That one wants to "see" themselves changing the area
    - But, obviously, it does not really work, for it decomposes with him
    - Mirrors="The (non-actual) Way Out"?
    - Simply creating an _image_ of control
