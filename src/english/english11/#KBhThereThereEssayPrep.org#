** Quote Development

*** Society's drugs dulls pain (No I)
- AO => drinking as something dulling and "solemn"
- AB => drinking as a form of slowing time
- AP => Thankful for spent indifference 
- AK => the white men draining the eyes (memories?) of natives to include only drugs or alcahol

*** Pressures of society holds Jaquie down (No second person)
- AD => pain as a pressure manifest in the atmosphere holding Jaquie down, nonchalantly (cool, chill, invisible. Also it's freaking air)
- AF => unlike the atmosphere, Jaquie want to see --- with her eyes --- the moving water (bubles rise) but Jaquie can't swim
- AN => air as something addictive, that provides temporary relief that also takes something from you

*** Wastepaper Basket
- AM => Jaqueline's actions reveal about her smoking habits, and it manifests visually through cough
- AA => the system rejects the pain that drive one to suicide
- AC => lack of static location of belonging and identity based on movement
- AG => home is a trap, belonging is a trap
- AR => systemic entertainment by the society (TV) favored by Jaquie over natural beauty
- AJ => dark memories as something her body (knee) forced into her mind (eyes)



* Claim Synthesis

| Symbol  | Representation     |
|---------+--------------------|
| Alcohol | Disenfranchisement |
| Eyes    | Memory/Knowledge   |
| Body    | Heritage           |
| Home    | Tradition          |
| Water   | Freedom            |
| Air     | Restraint          |

*In Tommy Orange's novel /There There/, the author's use of third-person perspective of Jacquie's character externalizes the systems in society which strip her of both a sense of identity and capacity to critique: creating a multifaceted grappling of the forces of oppression that plagues upon Native Americans in modern society.*
