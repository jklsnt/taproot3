# No, your the one who's actually fascist!



paris peace settlments marked the end of the war,

many european governments went into isolationaism, neutrality, or pasifism

created the leuge of nations

lots of unrest and economic instability, poverty, ect

hitler rose to power using this

usa teamed with the ssoviet union? to end nazi germany, then after the wwar it turned into distrust and rivary and the cold war


germany had a bunch of treaties, coudnt pay stuff, ended up hyper inflating.


american depressing hit, worldwide impacts, germany got hit especially hard,
demagogue time!


musolinni made fascism? believed in economic security and law and order, even if done through dictatorship 



hitler did stuff like musssolina, wiggled his way into power, ect. 

except he did it in three months, not three years. 


hitler did alot of dictatorhsip stuff 


wasnt a control freak like stalin. 

> he missed meetin gs, worked irr egu lar hour s, and was often disorganized. Hitl er valu ed pers on al loyalty far more than efficiency.
