**Before we start, notes pre-globalization**

* Spanish royals actively prevented trade with China #why
* Current day, emphasis was placed around those in native American regions who were anti-Spanish, yet a large majority of the individuals who really brought globalization were Spanish 

# Effects of the Homogenoscene
    
## Silver...
* (Most?) Important asset  
* Got cheapened as soon as the Americas overflowed with it, leading to lot’s of silver problems [[KBhHIST201ProblemsWithSilver]]

## The Little Ice Age
See [[KBhHIST201LittleIceAge]] The Little Ice Age

## Capital Movement  
### Original, pre-globalized capitals
* All located within the tropics
    * Beijing
    * Viayanagar (Hindu capital) – Cairo
* Decidedly not western  
* Decidedly hot (maybe, but Beijing was definitely not hot #why)

### Globalized Capitals
* In the north, mostly
    * New York  
    * Chicago  
    * Tokyo  
    * Manchester
    * London
* Much more westiner
* ...and much colder

## Food for thought
* What are some ways that the world was linked together?  
* Trace the effects of a commodity around the world.
    * Silver [[KBhHIST201ProblemsWithSilver]] 
    * Disease
    * Cold weather [[KBhHIST201LittleIceAge]]
    * Slaves
    * Vegetables
    * Horses
    * Wars
    * Wood
    * Corn
* What does the homogenocene mean to Mann?
    * Changes to state position?
    * Shift of power? 
 * What was the extent and the limits of Spanish power during this period?

***

**Look out!**: interesting to see when population _drops_/_booms_ instead of climbing/falling _slowly_.

For instance, take Mexico City

* Was really "on top of it"
* But did not experience rapid growth

# Maps
Guiding question: **what tensions and contrasts do you see between the different maps?** 

_Look for where the boundaries don't match.__

[Them Maps](https://taproot.shabang.cf/2020HIST201/Maps.pdf)

* When looking at GDP , remember to analyze GDP vs. Population 
* Places worth interest
    * Tokyo
    * Shanghai
    * Gulf of Oman
* Places to perhaps focus
    * Transportation w.r.t economy
    * Trans-boundary Rivers w.r.t. conflicts
    * River control w.r.t. control of power
    * Religious boundaries w.r.t. sectarian violence
