# The Ottoman Government, an Overview

@sushu

## Heads of government
1. Sultan
2. Grand vizier
3. Millitary elite — Jannissaries

## Civic Law, Taxation, and Education 
The Ottomans assigned the basic administrative tasks to each person's religion. Hence, the point of civic authority for the Ottoman subjects is as follows:

* Muslims => Shaykh
* Christians => Patriarch
* Jews => Grand Rabbi

Grand Vizier + Sultan appoint the heads of each religion

## Criminal Law, Tax Collection, Military, and Policing
For items that involve forcible enforcement, the Ottomans instead relied on instruments under the direct control of the Sultans

1. Local administrator
2. Governors

Devshirme system pluck young Christian boys and train them in islam to appoint governors + local administrators. 

## Conflict and Corruption

Eventually, government corruption led the Janissaries to become hereditory, and then [[KBhHIST201OttomansFall1500s]] sadness.

If religions have conflict, the injured party's religion's laws presides, unless one member of the conflict is muslim, then in which case muslim laws conflict.
