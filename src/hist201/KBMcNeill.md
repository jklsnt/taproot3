# Europe's Self-Transformation

Main thrust of development: politics.

Power was concentrated 

Each region or so had its own ruler, and was bordered (ish), but they were connected by a single center. 


> political consolidation 

Bunch of wars fought around religion. 

Consolidation "reflected" massive advances in military technology.

What do they mean by reflected? Like advanced, but they cant say for sure? like happened at the same time, but causation is unclear?

Weapons become better and more powerful, organization and resource allocation becomes more important 

This forced more centralization?

Religious worries started to re-emerge after the renaissance 

Many of the changes that happened to Europe were started (catalyzed?) by religious controversy. 

Bunch of tech increase despite religious wars

Science did not oppose religious beliefs, necessarily 

###### Perceived importance of universal agreement decreased
