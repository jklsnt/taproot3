# Europe on the Brink

Before its transformation in the 1500s, Europe was quite behind in terms of its technological + cultural developments. European knowledge of oriental culture was fragmentary + wrong => Constructed based on retold tales 

## The Weak Europe
### Geography
* Shaped awkwardly (ice  + water bound)
* Easily invaded by land from the east
    * By 1500, Granada, the Muslim rule of Spain has just collapsed 8 years ago
* Easily arrived by water from the western front
* Fall of Constantinople happened 1453

### Technology 
* Did not invent modern numbers a la arabia + China
* Did not engage in active foreign trade a la  India and Islam
* Most of what it had was borrowed from Eastern counties
    
### Leadership     
* Never did all of Europe acknowledge one leader 
    * Small kingdoms + lordships => Fighting
    * Could not ralley around religious image
