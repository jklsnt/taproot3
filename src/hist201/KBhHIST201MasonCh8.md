## Rise of Imperialism

**CLAIM: Reasons for african scramble: national pride, stsrategic competition, new markets, raw material, and labor!** => Used colonies as effective tax-evasion zones free of tariffs

* Also, Europeans felt taking over other countries is also humanitarian.
* Self-imposed tariffs lead to “economic protectionism, which furthered the decline in trade
* Thayer Mahan recognized the importance of having a navy to colonization (Big Brit Navy => Big Brit Colony); so, Amercia and Germany beefed up tehir navy and began a series of naval-based conquests.

* **Social darwinism**: the survival of the fittest applies to natinos — hence advocates for imperilasm

* Spread of imperialism began from spain => French => dutch => England.
* communists claimed that imperialism is the natural consiquence of capitalism
* First to colonize is the first to rebel. Case and point: Amercia.

### The History

* Construction of the Suez canal created a boom in shipping.
* Belgian king Leopold’s assigment of journalist Henry Stanley established the Congo Free State.
* Alarmed, other nations joined in and established guidelines for how to divide the continent into effective sizes.
* 2 countries spared from the scramble: Ethiopia, a native empire, and Liberia: a colony for freed american slaves.
* the dutch Boers and the british fought over who cotrolled South Africa and surrounding diamond mines. Eventually, the brits won.

## Asia 
* Britian Asian colonization: India! Rich source of manpower and resources.
* The French took Vietnam, but strong nationalism drove them out in the 1950s.
* Pressure from all fronts lead china to establish interlocking treaties that gave europeans de facto control to key trade regions. => CLAIM: this eventually lead to the death of China, the Empire

## Models and Results of Imperialism

* through imperialism, European culture became the dominant viewpoint in much of the southern hemisphere.
* Cities show up, and so did production of cash crops + a cash economy.
* European education stimulated literacy.
