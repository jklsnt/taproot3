# On China, Ropp. (63 - 70)



## Fall + aftermath of the Qing Empire (1800 - 1920)

- European powers competing for world dom through trade and warfare
- chinese trade sucked
	- British traders became frustrated
	- But they liked the chinese products alot and were buying alot of them
- Merchants ranked low in confucian vlue system 
- trade to the Qing gov was not for generationg wealth but rather more like a charity granted to the "barbarians"
	- In exchange, they would pay respects to the son of heaven and his court? 
- Led to bad trade conditions for the british merchants
- denied british requests for better env, emporer said 
	- > standard emperor’s command to his lowly subjects: “Tremblingly obey and show no negligence!”
	- fun. 
- > The emperor’s condescending attitude reflected how little he under stood the power realities of the world at the end of the eighteenth cen- tury.
-  Opium got added to the mix, 
	- changed the flow from basicly soley china -> britin (tea) to britin -> chin (opium)
- Opium addiction went crazy 
- Totally killed trade surplus
- Chinese gov destroyed a bunch of opium, britian sent warships 
- Totally chrushed chinese forces 
- led to the british taking control over the policies, and increased opium trade a bunch 
- bunch of rebelions occured, see pg. 66.5 
- Japan beat the Qing in a war, got taiwan? 
	- Becuase of this, other governments backed off on China out of fear that it would collapse 
- Also led to (lots of) civil unrest
- Heavy westernization occured
- reformers got crushed, conservatives seized control of the court
- bunch o' dates and stuff about revolutionaries
- Look how it ended on pg. 70!
