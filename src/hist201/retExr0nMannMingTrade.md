## Facts
- China tried to control trade/currency
- A lot of inflation happened
- Money was eventually privatized

## Claims
- China "let in the flood" for two factors
	- political
		- originally wanted to control trade ("foreign goods, not foreign people")
		- but this backfired, so they allowed trade to regain control
	- economic
		- silver coinage because original currency was not trusted
- "China's efforts to control piracy were hampered by incompetence at the top level"
- "By the time the wokou were terrorizing the southeast coast, the Chinese empire had no functioning currency"

## Questions
- Why didn't the rulers avoid printing so much money? They must've seen inflation coming
