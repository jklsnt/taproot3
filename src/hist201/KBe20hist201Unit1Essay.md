# Planning
- bulliet, maybe a little bit of gelvin for ottoman silver
- gelvin talks about silver trade a little, 17th century collapse was because silver
- mann talks about silver on spain
- why did china react the way they did and how did it affect them?

- as you look at differing responses, might pull in how silver trade relates to creatinog of trade based vs territory based empires
    - or similarities and differences and those become the paragraphs
    - maybe everyone reacted differently and some were screwwed less because silver but more blank (centralization, conservatism)

- ways different
    - differnt trade treaties
    - maybe silver made different impacts on their economic system
- next steps
    - think about how ottoman vs ming silver reaction differed

# Literally All the Things
## Ottomans
### Ottoman military replaced cavalry with Janissaries to save money and be more effective, but it backfired
#source bulliet
- Ottoman military was originally made of cavalry and Janissaries
- Cavalry were paid with land, while Janissaries were paid with money. Janissaries were also more effective under devshirme 
- to regain land, government squeezed out cavalry 
- Inflation from south american silver also caused fixed currency peoples to struggle
- all this led to revolt (cavalry + suddenly poor people)
- Janissaries took advantage to make "Janissication" hereditary and marry/start businesses
- Revolts + Ended up costing more -> government struggling

### Ottomans didn't produce their own metals, so it all got traded away
#source bulliet
- European silver created a wave of inflation, where european traders had more silver than ottoman internal merchants
- Safavid Iran also needed precious metals so they traded with the ottomans for it, which meant the ottomans had even hard money
- Some use of copper coins which were inflation resistant?

### "penetration of European merchant capital"
#source cleveland
- ottoman merchants traded raw materials for european manufactured products
	- benefited merchants, hurt government revenues
	- lack of raw materials caused inflation
	- This meant government couldn't pay military
	
### Capitulations
#source cleveland
- treaties originally meant to encourage international trade
- later exploited by european merchants with stronger military to back them up


#### First Capitulation
- Signed with france in 1536
	- french merchants could trade with low taxes, etc in ottoman ports
	- merchants would be punished under french law
- See example: #source primary-franc-ottoman-treaty

### Government weakening
#source cleveland
- Caused by inflation
- government workers were on a fixed wage
	- when in inflation happened, they were not paid enough
	- were more likely to take bribes and "other forms of corruption"
	- lead to declining military -> embarrassing treaties -> Treaty of Küchük Kay-narja (1774) -> Russia meddling with ottoman politics
	- "technological advantage lost"
	
## Ming
### Smuggled Silver
#source mann homogenocene
- The conflict
	- Spanish government wanted all silver in spain
	- trading silver and gold in china was more profitable than anywhere else
- disagreement
	- Official sources say 25% silver was smuggled to china
	- Historians assumed no more 10%
	- New research argues that smuggling took maybe half of silver to china
- implications
	- was the economy driven by european expansion or chinese demand?
### Money Troubles
#source mann ming trade
- unreliable state currency lead to merchants using hunks of silver
	- bronze coins too cheap and not enough to go around
	- paper money easily inflated
	- new emperors kept outlawing old coins and creating new ones that immediately destabilized
	- merchants started using small silver ingots
	
#### Silver as money
- Bowls 1-4 inches in diameter
- purity certified by "kanyinshi"
	- who regularly cheated all parties
- money not issued by government
	- privatized money
	- very not conservative
- basically all transactions + taxes silver by 1570

#### Lack of Silver
- Chinese silver mines ran dry, needed source from other places
	- japan, kinda
	- wokou, traded a bit of silver for many goods (much silk and porcelain)
- wokou silver -> business people -> taxes -> government -> military -> attacks on wokou
	- "The ming government was at war with its own money supply"
- Thus, the government had to allow the Fujianese traders
	- they went around, and found boats of money in the Philippines

### silver trade primary sources
#source silver trade dbq
- Doc2: lots of silver was traded through the Philippines
- Doc3: silver is scarce (economic deflation)
- Doc4: portuguese trade silver for goods in China, goods for silver in japan
- Doc5: more strict economics with silver currency
- Doc6: spanish silver production
	- **silver mine discovered in 1545**
	- by spanish records, 326000000 coins
		- **does not include smuggling!**
- Doc7: ming official asks to repeal trade ban for much profit
- Doc8: England trades china silver for "luxary items" that are of no use, but can't stop because someone else would take over trade and just sell to them at higher price.

## Kennedy Bashing on People
### Ming
- "sheer conservatism of the Confucian bureaucracy"
- "did not reassess" when people appeared off the coast
- "dislike of commerce and private capital"
- restricted technology (canals, clocks, printing)
- spent money on land and education instead of technology

### Ottomans
- "falter, to turn inward, and to lose the chance of world domination"
- strategical overextension
- many enemy states around (after crazy fast expansion)
- incompetent sultans in succession
	- "an idiot sultan could paralyze the ottoman empire in the way that a pope or holy roman emperor could never do for all europe"
- lack of expansion after 1550 caused Janissaries to turn to internal plunder
- merchants (many foreign) may be seized

### Similarities in Kennedy's eyes
- conservative
- stopped military expansion/exploration
- incompetent leaders
- doesn't like merchants 

# Outlining
## Thesis Ideas
“kennedy said that the ming and the ottomans suffered the same downfall, and while they did both ultamately struggle due to spanish silver inflation and european traders, the inflationary loop started with emperors in ming china while the ottomans just kinda got stomped + janissaries weren’t vere patriotic”

Although the economies of both the Ottoman and Ming empires suffered due to spiraling inflation and European trade, their misfortunes were not as similar as Kennedy suggests: the Ottomans' overstretched military was undermined by Europeans trading silver while the Mings' internal inflation spiral forced trade with and ultimately destruction by Europeans.

## Body 1 (choice A)
### Topic
Kennedy said the ming and the ottomans suffered the same downfall due to centralization and economic troubles.

### Evidence
- "[the ottomans] were to falter [...] strikingly similar Ming decline" (Kennedy 11)
- "The system as a whole, like that of Ming China, increasingly suffered from some of the defects of being centralized, despotic, and severely orthodox in it's attitude toward initiative dissent, and commerce." (Kennedy 11)
- "dislike trade" similarities
	- "Merchants ant entrepreneurs (nearly all of whom were foreigners), who earlier had been encouraged, now found themselves subject to unpredictable taxes and outright seizures of property" (Kennedy 12) 
	- "The mandarins [had] a suspicion of trader" (Kennedy 8)
	- "[The mandarins] dislike of commerce and private capital [...]" (Kennedy 8)

## Body 1 (choice B)
