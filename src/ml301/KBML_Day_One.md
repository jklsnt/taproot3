	- eg. if you don't learn well with presentations, you don't have to listen. 
- Assignments are individual. ==cite your sources!== working with classmates is okay, but you need to cite them.

### What is Machine learning?

My answer: Algorithms which learn from experience. 

> Almost always involves large amounts of data. The more data the better. 

Expensive to process - focus on the simplest way to get a *decent* answer

### Ethics

How did we get the data? 
Do the people we got that data from consent?


Algo = thing we use to process data
Model = thing we get at the end. Algo + plus weights 
`Algo != Model`
