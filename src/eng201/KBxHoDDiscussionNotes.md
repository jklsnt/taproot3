# Two

- Riley explains some context
- Aime describes
	- dehumanization
	- objecitifes the woman
		- beucase shes beutiful physically, marlow has more respect
	- the intended was viewed as emotional and docile 

- Rowan adds
	- Beuty is inherently primal
		- stems from necessity
			- this is an intresting point. fits with the "Europe no better" thesis.
			
- anoushka
	- we dont see her often
	- justaposition off...?
		- hard to hear 
	- strange descriptions of beuty
		- ah, the justaposition of beuty and savage? 

- riley 
	- kurzt is like a cult leader
	- described similary in some fashions to the natives 
	- sedces his follower, buts gets seduced himself by the heart of darkness 
	- > takes priority over rational thinking 
	
- aime says
	- that marlow is emotinally detached until the end
		- even when pointing our the horrid things that are happening
- rowan responds
	- describes violence to "his people" in much more detail
		- huge contrast in the descriptions
			- this is proof of racism(ish)! says rowan 
				- framed narritive means that this is weird



# Four (I know how to count trust me)



> 1. Is the racism in Heart of Darkness a parody of European racism during colonial times or is it Conrad's inherent racism?    
> 2.  How did the different people who told Marlow about Kurtz alter his opinion on him, how much did their opinions influence Marlow and why did they hold more/less value? 
- Calder starts
	- is conrad inherently racist
		- why do we keep talking about this? this is not related! (not what calder said)
		
- Nico says
	- Conrad is truly racist
		- becuase black people speak once or twice and are dehumanized
		- its not satire 
		
- Calder respondes 
	- bassicly says it can be a depiction distinc from conrads actual beliefs 
		- hard to distinguis
			- this is a good point. thx calder

- Isabella
	- uses the n-word, therefore, is racist!

- kayla
	- pattern of the n-word, therefore, nword isnt parody, therefore, is racist!
	- an author cannot have a racist protagonist withoutgh being racist
		- uh

- Nico says
	- that marlow isnt protrayed as having any flaws, and therfore, conrad is racist!

- isabella responds
	- actully marlow is painted with flaws 


- kayla adds
	- conrad is writing about his experience through marlow
		- hmmmm
		
- nico says
	- that conrad says that europeans have been dragged down by africa
	- therfore, he truly is, racist 
	
- isabella asks
	- clarifying question
	
- calder
	- europe is infecting africa
	- europe is the heart of darkness
		- oooh, intrestingg
	- maybe both cus they were infected

$$Question\ Break$$

- isabella

	- flip flops alot
	
- kayla disagrees with nico
	- says that marlow doesnt belive what he said to the intended
	- did nico say this? he very well may have
