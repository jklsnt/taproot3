And now, an **assignment** to begin the year:

# Four Questions

- What do you love learning about?

I love learning about all facets of human experience. However, I have a particular interest about computer science + ethics and how it connects to philosophy. 

- What are you most looking forward to this school year?

I look forward to being back in class — working with everyone in person and being able to have organic and captivating conversations spontaneously.

- What is a favorite book or film?

My favourite book is probably, at the moment, Triggers by Marshall Goldsmith.

I don't actually watch a lot of movies ;)

- What you want to work on in English class this semester?

For this year in English, I look forward to performing more holistic analysis of texts: tracking items not just on the micro level (word choice, motifs, etc.) nor just on the macro level (plot, theme) but being able to effectively connect them together.
