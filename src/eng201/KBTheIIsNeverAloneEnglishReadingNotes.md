[[KBhENG201TheIIsNeverAlone]] Jack's Take
[[KB2NotesonTheIIsNeverAlone]] Exr0n's take

==Mirrors== reflection - same with the parrots? #why 

> the depth of his solitude 


Captures parrots, lets them <ins>struggle</ins>

Trains parrots while feeding seeds (reward training)

> by instructing one another, soon all the parrots on the isle were repeating Siriak's name from dawn to dusk


Colonization? Culture spread / destruction..?

> In spite of the continual presence of his self which he was confined to by solitude, he struggled to remember that he also existed outside of himself. 


Cannot escape himself due to his solitude
Confined to his point of view? Lacks empathy because nothing to have empathy for?
Merely as an object, he is not unique? 



> Siriak walked about his minuscule empire and saw in passing his omnipresent reflection at every turn. 

**Solitude / not being to escape himself.**


Dies, and becomes part of the island. 
> Bones mix with the sand ..  parrots continued to cry out his name, and it reverberated *forever*

Lasting impact? Legacy? "the *I* is never alone," because impact always accompanies? 
Something missing in translation...?
