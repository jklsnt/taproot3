## Assignment
> **English 10, Assessment  #1: Close Reading Paragraph**
> Topic: You will be writing on one of the short stories from our packet: “The I is Never Alone” or “The Bird-Dreaming Baobab.” (For extra challenge, you may choose from the Elizabeth Bishop “challenge poems” at the end of the packet). 
> Choose an aspect of the short story or poem that will enable close reading: a word pattern, a significant image, a literary device, a repeated detail, etc. In your topic sentence and paragraph, answer the following question:
> What does this aspect of the text reveal about the story/poem’s broader themes? This is a broad prompt, and I am available to help you narrow it as you begin pre-writing.
> This paragraph assesses the following template items: 
> 
> - Understanding Literature: Form and Function
> - Close Reading and Argumentation
> - Structure and Mechanics
> - The Writer's Voice
> 
> ### Important reminders:
> - Length: One paragraph, so 250-350 words
> - Paragraph format: MLA style, double-spaced, 12-point font
> - In this paragraph, one of your primary goals is to demonstrate your close reading skills. Close reading means unpacking the meaning of individual words and phrases.
> - If you write about a pattern/image/etc. that we discussed in class, you need to go above and beyond class discussion so that I can see your own thinking. 
> - Include page numbers for citations.

## Planning

### Text
I wanted to use the pronouns based on narrorator vs settlers for the bird seller in bird dreaming baobab, but I'm not sure what that "reveals about the story/poem's broader themes". So, I will write about the specificity of numbers in the I is never alone instead.

### Markup
I realized that I didn't really want to write about the specificity of numbers, because that felt too obvious after talking about it in class. I noticed that the word "Siriak" appears in differing intensities throughout the text, and decided to visualize it with a rolling average: https://github.com/Exr0nRandomProjects/exr0n20eng201retA1analysis

### Thesis
The frequency of self reference is directly correlated with idleness, suggesting that identity and reflection are in opposition.

### Evidence
~~Trough at beginning of paragraph 5 is when lands on the island, shipwrecked.
Peak halfway through paragraph 6 is when he catches and teaches the parrots.
Trough at paragraph 8 is when "he struggled to remember that he also existed outside himself"~~ < That was the old graph, with stats before instead of around.

Half way through paragraph 2: Siriak realizes his companions are dead and takes over the ship
Spike at 6: Siriak captures parrots
Dip at end of 7: parrots call for Siriak (although he does nothing himself)
Spike at beginning of 9: "and so the weeks and months flew by"

## Outline

### Thesis
The local frequency of references to Siriak
