#+TITLE: Calypso Poem by Kamau Braithwaite
* listening
** many lines follow the calypso pattern
** but some clash
** 2 and 3 specifically clash
* silent reading
** some of the later stanzas really do fall apart, both rhyme scheme and structure
** pattern of fast and slow sections
** seems to loose structure the way the island life collapsed
* reading + calypso music
** most lines go together with the music, but some lines are far shorter / should be combined
** don't clash as much as I expected, the music gives the poem structure
** eliza sanders: cheery music seems to make it even darker
