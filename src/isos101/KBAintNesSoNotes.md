talks about how evolutionary phycology does not talk about variation 

and about how its not worth it to explore the roots of behavior 

This reading talks a lot about the point of evolutionary psychology, claiming that how things came to doesn't matter -- only how things are. Of course, the obvious rebuttal is that through understanding the way things came to be, we can better understand them as they exist now. The author argues that this rarely happens. I wonder if anyone is actually reading this discussion point. Anyways, I would argue that understanding the way things develop allows us to gain an understanding of emergent properties and therefore how the future will develop, regardless of whether or not it is truly useful in understanding our current universe.
