$|x-2||x+4| < \epsilon$
so near $x=2$, $|x-2|$ is smol, so the primary term contributing to the value of the total function is $|x+4|$. Using the above condition, $|x-2| < 1 \Rightarrow 1 < x < 3 \Rightarrow 5 < x+4 < 7$

So, $|x+4|$ is at most $7$, we could try substituting it in and getting $7|x-2| < \epsilon$. Also do the other side: $5|x-2| < \epsilon$

You also need to do this:

for the actual proof.
