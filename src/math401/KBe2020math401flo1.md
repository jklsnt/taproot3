### Math Is
- "...take a moment to delight in the question itself;"
- Inspirations 
	- Measurement | paul lockhart
	- the jazz of physics | Stephon Alexander

#### Advice
- the best problems are your own
- collaborate
- let it be hard. try not to get discouraged or to take your failures too personally.
	- just be yourself and go where you want to go. instead of being tentative and fearing failure or confusion, try to embrace the awe and mystery of it all and joyfully make a mess
- do not ignore symmetry
"a proof is simply a story... the plot not only has to make logical sense but also be simple and elegant."
- improve your proofs; critique your work, let a problem take you where it takes you
- try things. Guess. As you do more math, your intuition and your instincts will sharpen...to provide _sensitivity to structure_

#### Interdisciplinary Cross Fertilization
- borrow analogy from what "might, at first glance, be a complexly unrelated discipline."
- "it is in the _limits_ of these analogies where there exists a need for further research."
- "what are you getting at?" "I don't know."

#### Book Recommendations
- Journey through Genius
