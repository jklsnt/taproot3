## Thought Processes
- As geometric transformations
- As algebraic transformations

## Examples
$\begin{matrix}x &0 \\ 0 &y\end{matrix}$ | Scale by $x$ and $y$
$\begin{matrix}0 &1 \\ -1 & 0\end{matrix}$ | Rotate -90deg (easier to visualize geometrically, also two reflections (over $y=x$ and $y=0$))
$\begin{matrix}1 &1 \\ 0 &1\end{matrix}$ | Add $y$ to $x$ (easier to visualize algebraically, also a shear)

# Rotation Matrices
- We can get 90deg rotations decently easily, but what about other angles?
