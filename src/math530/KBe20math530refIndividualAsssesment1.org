* Definitions
** DONE group
   CLOSED: [2020-10-24 Sat 11:23]
   A set and binary operation that satisfies Group Properties
   - Closed
   - Identity
   - Inverse
   - Associative
** DONE field
   CLOSED: [2020-10-24 Sat 11:23]
   A set and two binary operations: the primary (addition) and secondary (multiplication) that "mostly" satisfies group properties for both operations, and are *commutative and distributive*.
   It must be a group under the primary operation and a group under the secondary operation except without a secondary inverse for the primary indentity.
** DONE non-singular matrices
   CLOSED: [2020-10-24 Sat 11:26]
   singular matrix: has no inverse.
   non-singular matrix: has an inverse aka determinant non zero
* Connections
** DONE connect direct sum and linear independence
   CLOSED: [2020-10-24 Sat 11:28]
   the sum of two spaces is direct if their basises are linearly independent
** DONE matrices to represent complex numbers
   CLOSED: [2020-10-24 Sat 13:28]
   The negative one matrix is $\begin{bmatrix}-1&0\\0&-1\end{bmatrix}$ and we want the square root of that. It turns out that $\begin{bmatrix}0&-1\\1&0\end{bmatrix}$ satisfies this, and in fact, any complex number $a + bi$ can be represented as $\begin{bmatrix}a&-b\\b&a\end{bmatrix}$.
   These matrices are commutative under multiplication (like complex numbers should be), have their complex conjugates equal to their transposes, and a bunch of other nice properties. Also related to rotation matrices.

* Computation
** DONE Find the determinant of matrices
   CLOSED: [2020-10-24 Sat 11:59]
   $$\left|\begin{matrix}a&b\\c&d\end{matrix}\right| = ad-bc$$
** DONE compute cross product
   CLOSED: [2020-10-24 Sat 12:16]
   $$
   \begin{pmatrix}a\\b\\c\end{pmatrix}\times\begin{pmatrix}d\\e\\f\end{pmatrix} = \left|\begin{matrix}i&j&k\\a&b&c\\d&e&f\end{matrix}\right| = i \left|\begin{matrix}b&c\\e&f\end{matrix}\right|+ j\left|\begin{matrix}c&a\\f&d\end{matrix}\right| + k\left|\begin{matrix}a&b\\d&e\end{matrix}\right| = bf-ce, cd-fa, ae - bd
   $$
** DONE Find equations of lines and planes using cross product and dot product
   CLOSED: [2020-10-24 Sat 13:52]
   Use the cross product to find an orthagonal vector $\vec p$. The plane is all vectors that are orthagonal to $\vec p$, which is to say that the dot product is zero ($\left\{ \vec{u} : \vec{u}\cdot\vec{p} = 0 \right\}$).
* Derivations
** DONE properties of the determinant
   CLOSED: [2020-10-24 Sat 13:17]
*** zero when matrix has no inverse (singular)
*** det = -1 for rotation matrices?

** DONE inverse of a 2x2 matrix
   CLOSED: [2020-10-24 Sat 12:41]
   $$ \begin{bmatrix}a&b\\c&d\end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix}e&f\\g&h\end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix}1&0\\0&1\end{bmatrix} $$
   $$ \begin{aligned} ae+bg = 1\\ ce+dg = 0\\ af+bh = 0\\ cf+dh = 1\\ \end{aligned} $$
   Then you do some algebra to get
   $$
   \begin{aligned}
   e = \frac{d}{ad-bc}\\
   g = \frac{-c}{ad-bc}\\
   f = \frac{-b}{ad-bc}\\
   h = \frac{a}{ad-bc}\\
   \end{aligned}
   $$
** DONE rotation matrices
   CLOSED: [2020-10-24 Sat 13:09]
   Don't try to algebra it. Use polar coordinates and the angle sum trig identities:
   $$\begin{aligned}
   \sin(\alpha + \beta) = \sin\alpha\cos\beta + \cos\alpha\sin\beta\\
   \cos(\alpha + \beta) = \cos\alpha\cos\beta - \sin\alpha\sin\beta
   \end{aligned}$$

   anyways, you get $\begin{bmatrix}\cos\theta&\sin\theta\\-\sin\theta&\cos\theta\end{bmatrix}$.
