#+TITLE: Fundamental Theorem of Linear Maps!
#+AUTHOR: Exr0n
* Intuition
  In a linear map $T : V\to W$, the dimension of the domain $V$ is amount of stuff that you throw away (null space) *plus* the amount of stuff that does not get thrown away (the column space).
  +If $T$ is a map from $V$ to $W$, then the dimension of the source map $V$ is the dimension of the null space (everything in $V$ that $T$ takes to 0) plus the dimension of the range (all possible things taken to by $T$)+
* #definition Fundamental Theorem of Linear Maps                        :def:
  #+begin_quote
  Suppose $V$ is finite-dimensional and $T \in \mathcal L(V, W). Then \text{range }T is finite-dimensional and
  $$ \text{dim }V = \text{dim null }T + \text{dim range} T $$
