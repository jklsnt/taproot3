# Proof by Induction
Using Axler 2.C 10 as an example.

## Induction building blocks

### Base Case:
**Prove for the simplest case**

Prove for $\mathcal{P}_0(\mathbb{R})$.

### Inductive Step
**Show that if case $n$ is correct, then case $n+1$ is also correct**

Assume that it works for $\mathcal{P}_i(\mathbb{R})$, then prove it for $\mathcal{P}_{i+1}(\mathbb{R})$.
