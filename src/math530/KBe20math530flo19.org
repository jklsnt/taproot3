  - maybe it's like matrices
  - or linear maps themselves
* The Linear Map 0
  A linear map $S = 0$ is a map where $Su = 0 \forall u$.

  Let $w = Tv$.

** If $v = 0$ then
   $$Tv = 0$$
   By Axler 3.11 (Maps take 0 to 0). Thus, $\lambda$ can be anything in $\mathbb F$.

** Otherwise,
   $\frac{1}{v} \in \mathbb F$ because the field has multiplicative inverses for all elements except 0.
   $$
   Tv = w = \left( w \frac{1}{v} \right)v
   $$
   Let $\lambda = w \frac{1}{v}$, then
   $$ \lambda v = w \frac{1}{v} v = w $$
   which is in $\mathbb F$ because $w, \frac{1}{v} \in \mathbb F$ and fields are closed under multiplication.

  The additivity of a linear map $T$ requires $T(u+v) = Tu + Tv$. Because $U \subset V, U \neq V$, there must be some element $v \in V$ yet $v \notin U$.

  For some element $u \in U$,
  $$Tu + Tv = Su + 0 = Su$$
  Yet $u+v \notin U$ because if it were, then $(u+v)+(-v) = v$ would be in $U$. Thus,
  $$T(u+v) = 0$$

  Because for some $u$ $Su\neq 0$, additivity does not hold over $T$ and thus the map is not linear.
