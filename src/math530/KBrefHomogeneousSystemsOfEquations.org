#+TITLE: Homogeneous Systems of Equations
* See Before: [[file:KBrefHomogeneousEquations.org][homogeneous equations]]
* Homogeneous systems of linear equations with more variables than equations has nonzero solutions (Axler3.26)
** Intuition
   If you have more variables than equations, then some variables won't be restrained by the equations.
* Inhomogeneous systems of linear equations with more equations than variables have no solution for some choice of constant terms
** Intuition
   If you have more equations than variables, then some choice of constant terms (some set of equations) will be to constraining.
* methodology
  Basically turn it into a linear map and then abuse the injective/surjective theorems
