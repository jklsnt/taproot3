* Algebreic and Geometric Multiplicities
  I missed the last ten minutes of class and had to look up what the algebreic and geometric multiplicities are. I used this [[https://people.math.carleton.ca/~kcheung/math/notes/MATH1107/wk10/10_algebraic_and_geometric_multiplicities.html][source]].

  Also it says something about
  #+begin_quote
  It is a fact that summing up the algebraic multiplicities of all the eigenvalues of an $n\times n$ matrix $A$ gives exactly $n$.
  #+end_quote
  Which reminds me of the fundamental theorem of algebra...

** $\begin{pmatrix}4&-12\\2&0\end{pmatrix}$

*** Geometric multiplicity
	The null space is $\text{span } \begin{pmatrix}1\\1\end{pmatrix}$ which is dimension $\boxed{1}$.

*** Algebraic multiplicity
	The determinant of $\begin{pmatrix}2&-2\\2&-2\end{pmatrix}$ is
	\[ -\lambda(4-\lambda) - (-4) = \lambda ^2 -4\lambda + 4 = (\lambda -2)^2 \]
	So the algebraic multiplicity is $\boxed{2}$

** $\begin{pmatrix}1&1&2\\0&1&-1\\0&0&3\end{pmatrix}$

*** Geometric
	Null space of 1 ($(x, 0, 0)$) has dim 1. Null space of 3 ($\left(x, \frac{-2x}{3}, \frac{4x}{3}\right)$) has dim 1 as well.

*** Algebraic
	The determinant simplifies to one factored term:
	\[ (1-\lambda)^2(3-\lambda) \]
	So 1 has a multiplicity 2 and 3 has multiplicity 1?


** $\begin{pmatrix}1&0&2\\0&1&-1\\0&0&3\end{pmatrix}$

*** Geometric
	For $\lambda = 1$, null space is $(x, y, 0)$ so dim 2. For $\lambda = 3$, null space is $(x, \frac{-x}{2}, x)$ so dim 1.

*** Algebraic
	The determinant is the same as the previous matrix, so once again, 1 has multiplicity 2 and 3 has multiplicity 1.
