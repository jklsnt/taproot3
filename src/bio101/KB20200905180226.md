# Notes
- Carbohydrates are found in all living things that we know of and are critical to our functioning
    - There is a lot of debate surrounding how much is good and how much is bad for us
- Carbohydrates usually have a long carbon chain with oxygen and hydrogen branching off of it
    - Usually they are tipped with hydrogen, or a hydroxel group
- Can tend to mix with water well due to their polarity
    - They also chain with each-other really well due to their polarity which causes the long chains called polysaccarides 
    - They; however, do not dissolve in water very well
        - Large carbohydrates tend to dissolve in water well however
            - Cellulose
            - Starch
            - Glycogen
            - other such things
-  Hexagonal drawings and edges without labels should be assumed to be carbs unless said otherwise
-  These can be found on
    -  The cell membrane
    -  In cell walls
    -  Inside mitochondria
- Pubmed is a very good source and we should go directly to the research and read their conclusions instead of getting our scientific information through the news
