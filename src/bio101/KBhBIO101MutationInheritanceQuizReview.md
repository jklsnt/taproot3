# Mutation and Inheritance
## Cell Division, Cell Cycle & It's Regulation
**Each cell lives and reproduced on a cycle; unsurprisingly, this is called the [[KBhBIO101CellLifecycle]]!**

- These cell cycles create [[KBhBIO101GeneticVariation]], even in [[KBhBIO101Mitosis]], because yes!, in mitosis, there could be [[KBhBIO101Mutations]] which introduce variation
- However [[KBhBIO101Mutations]] could cause cancer if left unchecked, so we have [[KBhBIO101CellCycleRegulation]] to keep this cycle check.

**At the end of the cell cycle, a little bit of a thing happens where the cell replicates (or makes offsprings, so not necessarily exact copies of) itself. This bit of a thing's called [[KBhBIO101CellReproduction]].**

- This reproduction process uses one of either [[KBhBIO101Mitosis]] (exact copy, for somatic cells (not sperm/egg) only) or 
- [[KBhBIO101Meiosis]] (half, randomly-mixed genetic info, for gametes (sperm/egg) only).

## Genetics and Inheritance
[[KBhBIO101GeneticVariation]] is like, really good. However, its woefully complicated and there are at least 3 ways I think of that it happens. 

DNA's sequence could vary by itself, and that will cause a [[KBhBIO101Mutations]], which is actually very rarely bad news bears and instead simply introduces genetic variation if not doing nothing at all.

Organisms have different traits, and through [[KBhBIO101Meiosis]] these traits are mixed. But!  which one of these traits are expressed (dad passed blue-eye, mom passed red-eye, which one expressed?)?  Well, find out at [[KBhBIO101Inheritance]].

Specifically, the mixture of a "heterozygous" alleals (different genes from mother and father) will be determined by [[KBhBIO101GeneticInheritance]].
