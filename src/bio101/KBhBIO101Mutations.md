# Mutations
Mutations are one way by which totally random, not controlled for, and fully spontaneous genetic modifications happen to literally anywhere in any cell's DNA during [[KBhBIO101CellReproduction]]. Specifically, it involves an environmental factor or the sheer entropy of things to directly, or indirectly (by causing/creating a oopsie during [[KBhBIO101DNAReplication]]) _mutate_ the resulting supposed-to-be-exact copy of DNA.

Lot's of things cause mutations!

To figure out how mutations work, you first need to know how DNA looks like, so here goes a...

***
_**Special Programming!** How does DNA work?_

There are two rought typos of codons on DNA, namely: 

- **Pyrimides** - cytosine + thymine. Single ring.  Which are usually paired with... 
- **Purines** -  adenine + guanine. Double ring.

So if a mutation replaces adenine and guanine, it would has less of an effect because a double ring is still matched with a single ring. But if an adenine is replaced by thymine, we could have a bigger issue because double-double ring is much longer than a traditional single/double match.

Thank you for coming to this assembly. You could leave now.

## Mutation Vocab

**Trait**: characteristic of organism influnenced by its genes & modified by its enviroment

**Phenotype**: a collective subset of all the traits ("that looks different from wild type") in an organism

## And now, an example

Mutant hemoglobin could... 1) with one mutation, cause a slight change in the RBC but cause resistance to malaria 2) with two mutation, cause sickle-cell.

Remember that DNA codes for proteins, so mutations in DNA will cause different proteins BUT not necessarily different traits. In the case of 1-chromasome sickle-cell mutation, a protein is changed but the result is not nocessarily a different RBC.

## Types of Mutations
There are many types/methods by which DNA mutate. These different types dictate when they happen ([[KBhBIO101Meiosis]] or [[KBhBIO101Mitosis]]?), how severe they are, and also their frequency. See... [[KBhBIO101TypesOfMutations]]

## Impacts of mutations
Mutations does one of two things, which are both pretty obvious: they either cause a **loss of function** for the organism/cell or **gain of function** for the organism/cell (you either loose something or gain something... duh).

**Loss of function mutations**
- Complete loss of a proteins
- Reduction of a protein's ability to function

**Gain of function mutations**
- Increase the function of a protein
- Aquire new protein function 
- Expression of protein in new location/time

**Neutral function**
Does nothing :(

## Protein Pathways
Most DNA/proteins trigger in a pathway — in that an environment factor does not directly trigger a protein action; instead, a _sequence_ of actions from the surface down happen and mutation in any of that sequence of proteins may cause a difference in function.

For example, an growth hormone may attach to a receptor protein, which triggers an "explosion" in KRAS protein, which then triggers cell proliferation.

In a mutant KRAS case, however, the KRAS protein does not stop triggering and forever triggers.

This is a case of a "gain of function" mutation that causes an abnormal rapid cell cycle.
