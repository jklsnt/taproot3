# Properties of water

## Cohesion 
* Individual molecules held up well +
* Strong surface tension

## Adhesion
* Water attracts other molecules, and it stick to water pretty well
    * If we make water molecules touch another molecules, it will stick to it and start moving
    * Think: a straw — a thin straw could draw up water without additional pressure just by water working its way up using adhesion
* This is how we make "xylum" and "Pholem" happen
    * Water's adhesive force — and adhesive force only — is how water travels upwards from a tree
    * Given that some trees are, em, pretty tall, this means that the capillaries that the water travel in must be very small
    * A Pico-Gauge could be used to measure the pressures within the phorlem
    
## Water...
* is wet => Strong tetrahedral H-Bonds
* is sticky => Has both Cohesive and Adhesive Properties
* have a **high specific heat capacity.**
    * Strong bonds
    * Resistant to change
    
## Water's Universal Solvent Properties

Water has high solubility

* Many things could dissolve in water
* Makes chemical processes quite easily
* Quite versatile — could dissolve stuff easily

## Hydrophillic + Hydrophobic Effects of Water

- In hydrophillic senarios, water will to "puddle out" ("Wetting") — adheses to the surface
- In hydrophobic senarios, water leverage its cohesion properties to create spheres
