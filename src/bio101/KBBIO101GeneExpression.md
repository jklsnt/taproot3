# Notes

### Overview

 - Organisms turn genes on and off which is called Gene Expression
	 - This can be done in response to external and internal signals
		 - These signals are based off of environmental factors
	 - This is also be done in order to specialize cells
		 - Certain cells need certain genes to preform their specific role

 ### Differential Gene Expression
 
  - Human Cells can express about 20% of it's protein coded genes at any given time
  - Most cells contain the same genome
	  - Each cell type must use specific parts of this genome
		  - This is called Differential gene expression
	  - Exception would be cells of the immune system
  - Due to the importance of gene expression when it has issues it can affect the organism significantly
  - Process of Gene expression in a Eukaryotic cell
	  - Chromatin (DNA unpacking) -->
	  - RNA processing -->
	  - Transport to cytoplasm -->
	  - Translation -->
	  - Protein processing -->
	  - Transport to cellular destination-->
  - This process can often be equated to transcription for Prokaryote cells

### Regulation of Chromatin Structure

 - The chromatin structure itself allows for the regulation of gene expression
	 - This is partially due to the location of the promoter
 - Chemical modifications to the histone proteins can affect the structure
	 - This in turn can affect gene expression
	 - Histone proteins are the proteins in which the DNA is wrapped
	 - There are many types of modifications that can take place
		 - Histone acetylation can tend to promote transcriptions by opening up the chromatin
		 - Additional methyl groups tend to close up the chromatin and decrease transcription
	 - DNA methylation occurs in most plants and animals as well as fungi
	 - Methylated DNA will stay methalated through cell divisions
		 - This accounts for genomic imprinting
		 - These epigenetic markers can be inherited
			 - There is continually more evidence for the importance of epigentics in gene expression
### Regulation of Transcription
 - Chromatin changes are not permanent and can be reversed
 - The next step of gene expression regulation is in the transcription factors
	 - These either allow for or inhibit transcription
 - These factors usually bind to proteins, but some of them bind to DNA
 - High levels of transcription factors created for specific genes are associated with another protein thought creatively of as specific transcription factors
 - Gene expression is dramatically increased or decreased by the binding of specific transcription factors
	 - These are either activators or repressors
 - There are many transcription factors
	 - Repressors act in many different ways, but some bind directly to control element DNA blocking activator binding
	 - Others interfere with the activator itself
  - Coordinated control of genes can need to happen when multiple genes need to be expressed at the same time for something to function
	  - These can often be signaled from the outside with something like a hormone
  - The activation of receptors on the surface of the cell can release specific repressors and activators
 
 ### Mechanisms of Post-Transcriptional Regulation
 - Transcription is not the only thing that regulates gene expression
	 - How much of the protein is created once the RNA is received is also a factor
	 - RNA can be interpreted in different ways with different things being introns and others being exons
		 - This allows for the creation of multiple proteins from the same strand of RNA
 - RNA splicing is critical since it allows a lot of information to be fit on a single strand of RNA
	 - Around 75-100% of human genes with multiple exons undergo RNA splicing allowing for our genome to describe a lot of complexity without needing as many genes
 - Translation is another stage at which gene expression occurs
	 - Some regulatory proteins can bock translation of an mRNA by preventing attachment to a ribisome
	 - Length by which an mRNA is around is also crucial
		 - This can vary greatly depending on the cell
		 - Cells can mark proteins for destruction using something called ubiquitin
