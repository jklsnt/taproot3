# Bonds
### Carbohydrate Chains
 - Larger chains of carbohydrates don't have less, or more energy at the end of a reaction than seperate monomers since entropy.
 - A lot of carbohydrates moving around have a non-zero, but small chance of connecting. 
     - The longer the chains of carbohydrates, the less of a chance they have to connect to eachother
         - It's going to take a lot of energy to organize and then some energy is going to be released when they bond, but by the end it'll be very complex.
             - Eventually this will break up and you'll get the energy back
     - When forming complex molecules, you need energy, heat, something to put everything in place
