* Axler6.27 orthonormal basis                                           :def:
  #+begin_quote
  An /orthonormal basis/ of $V$ is an orthonormal list of vectors in $V$ that is also a basis of $V$.
  #+end_quote

  Pretty self explanatory.

  How do we find an orthonormal basis? see the
* results
** Axler6.28 orthonormal list of the right length is a basis
   Because it's linearly independent, and linearly independent lists of the right length are bases (Axler2.39).
** Axler6.30 vector as a linear combo of orthonormal basis
   Suppose $e_1, \ldots, e_m$ is an orthonormal basis of $V$ and $v \in  V$. Then,
   \[\begin{aligned}
   v = \langle  v, e_1 \rangle e_1 + \cdots \langle  v, e_n \rangle e_n
   \end{aligned}\]
   and

   \[\begin{aligned}
   \lVert v \rVert ^2 = |\langle v, e_1 \rangle|^2 + \cdots + \lvert \langle  v, e_n \rangle \rvert ^2
   \end{aligned}\]

   By taking the inner product of both sides of the equation
   \[\begin{aligned}
   v = a_1e_1 + \cdots + a_n e_n
   \end{aligned}\]
   with $e_j$ for each $e_j$. And also the Pythagorean theorem
