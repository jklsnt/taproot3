* In the context of Linear Algebra (Axler 3.20) #defintion surjective :def:
  #+begin_quote
  A function $T : V \to W$ is called /surjective/ if its range equals $W$.

** Properties
*** A non-surjective map can be made surjective by changing the output space. (intuitive, not in book)
*** A map to a larger dimensional space is not surjective (Axler3.24)
    #+begin_quote
    Suppose $V$ and $W$ are finite-dimensional spaces such that $\text{dim }V < \text{dim }U$. Then no linear map from $V$ to $W$ is surjective.
    #+end_quote
**** Intuition
     Surjectivity means that every element in the output space is mapped to, and that makes this intuitively true: If the number of possible inputs (and by extension, possible outputs) is smaller dimension than the output space, how can every output be mapped to?
