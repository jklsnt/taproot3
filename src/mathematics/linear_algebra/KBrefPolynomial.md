# In the context of linear algebra
- From Axler Linear Algebra Done Right 3rd Ed. 2.A
- #definition polynomial
	- > $p: F \to F$ with coefficients in $F$ if there exist $a_0, ..., a_m \in F$ such that $p(z) = a_0 + a_1z + a_2z^2 + ... + a_mz^m$
## Polynomial Degree
#definition degree of a polynomial
- Basically write it in standard form and find the highest index of the highest coefficient that isn't zero
- degree of $0$ = $-\infty$
