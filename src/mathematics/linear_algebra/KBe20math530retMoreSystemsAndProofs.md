## Solve Equations

Operation timed out. Arithmetic errors. #todo

## Read 1.B and 1.C
### General Notes
- The distributive property is extremely useful
### 1.35 Example
- a) If $b = 0$ then we can divide all $x_3$ by $5$ and combine the last two terms to get $F^3$, which is a vector space, without loss of generality. If not, then when you try to multiply by a scalar then you will find that the above reasoning breaks (i think).
- b) $f(x) = 0$ is continuous, so the additive identity exists. All sums of continuous functions result in continuous functions, so it is closed under addition. And all scalar multiples also work out.
- c) slightly awkward: i don't actually know what a differentiable real valued function is. #todo-exr0n
- d) (see previous)
- e) what does it mean for a sequence of complex numbers to have a limit $0$? but I think you can use the same argument that the missing elements are just "collapsed" into one invisible one.
### 1.40 Definition direct sum 
- Something about uniqueness? 
- If there is only one way to write zero then it works (1.44 Condition for a direct sum)

### Exercise to present
I would be interested in 7, 8, 10, 12, 14-19

## 2x2 Matrices that are Commutative
(under multiplication, with all other 2x2 matrices)

Starting with $\begin{bmatrix}a&b\\c&d\end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix}w&x\\y&z\end{bmatrix}=\begin{bmatrix}w&x\\y&z\end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix}a&b\\c&d\end{bmatrix}$, I got $(x+y)(a-d) = (b+c)(w-z)$ and $by=cx$, but wasn't sure how to further develop it.

## Epilogue

Linear algebra homework always takes so long. Even though I skip like half of the problems. This is kind of an issue.
