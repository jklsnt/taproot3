  An /inner product/ on $V$ is a function that takes each ordered pair $(u, v)$ of elements of $V$ to a number $\langle u, v \rangle \in \FF$  and has the following properties
  - *positivity* $\langle v, v \rangle \geq  0 \forall v\in V$
  - *definiteness* $\langle v, v \rangle = 0 \iff v = 0$
  - *additivity in first slot* $\langle u+v, w \rangle = \langle u, w \rangle + \langle v, w \rangle \forall u, v, w, \in V$
  - *homogeneity in first slot* $\langle \lambda u, v \rangle = \lambda \langle u,v \rangle \forall \lambda \in \FF, u,v \in  V$
  - *conjugate symmetry* $\langle u,v \rangle = \overline{\langle v,u \rangle} \forall u,v \in V$
	- Over the reals, this is equal to $\langle u,v \rangle = \langle v, u \rangle$

* motivation
** The norm of a complex number $\lVert z \rVert$ should be non-negative, so we can define it as
   \[\begin{aligned}
   \lVert z \rVert =\sqrt{|z_1|^2 + \cdots + |z_n| ^2}
   \end{aligned}\]
   Since the square of the absolute value is just a complex number times a conjugate, and because the norm squared should be the inner product of $z$ with itself, maybe the inner product of $w, z \in  \CC ^n$ should equal
   \[\begin{aligned}
   w_1 \overline{z_1} + \cdots + w_n \overline{z_n}
   \end{aligned}\]
** positivity: we want inner product to be the size of the vector, so it should be a positive and real number
** notation
   For a complex scalar $\lambda \in \CC$, $\lambda \geq 0$ means $\lambda$ is real and non-negative

   $\langle u, v \rangle$ denotes an inner product.
* intuition
** additivity/homogeneity in the first slot also implies additivity in the second slot, and 'conjugate homogeneity in the second slot'
** we want the norm to be a real scalar, so we need to take the complex conjugate of the second one
*** so, the Euclidean inner product is conjugate the second, then dot product
	\[\begin{aligned}
    \langle u, v \rangle = u \overline{z}
	\end{aligned}\]
