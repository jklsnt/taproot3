### Skills and Practices
**Previous -> New**

##### Explore and Organize
**Proficient -> Exemplary**
More recently for some of the harder problems, my strategy has shifted to first finding branches of concepts and results relating to the problem. For example, the most recent problem I did involved trying to navigate branching relationships between concepts -- the problem ended up being solved by representing our system of equations as an operator, thus allowing us to use the properties of an operator (surjectivity implying injectivity) to solve the problem. The process involved first trying to find branches that we could go down (generating data), navigating these branches (organizing data), and finally solving the problem with the right branch (identifying promising leads).

##### Generalize and Test
**Proficient -> ~Exemplary**
The way I try to understand linear algebra is by trying to connect the different concepts we learn and then find the patterns in the connections. While this strategy doesn't help me immensely when memorizing definitions, it makes a huge difference when solving problems or trying to understand new concepts. One of the more tangible ways this strategy manifests is in my note taking system, where I link together concepts to form a graph structure. For example, this is the low-depth graph structure formed from just the concept of linear combinations (highlighted in yellow):

##### Abstract and Symbolize
**Proficient, ~Exemplary -> Exemplary**
In order to take notes in class, I need to be able to record concepts quickly. The best way I have found to do this with math is to aggressively use the notation and tools. While I still struggle a little, I've gotten to the point where I can write Latex equations out live in class. As I've progressed through this class, I've also encountered ideas that I can intuitively explain using mathematical notation, but have to work harder to explain with words. One example of this was in my 3.A.12 proof:
$$T_k(a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n) = (a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n, b_1, b_2, \dots)$$
$$\textrm{where}$$
$$\{b_1, b_2, \cdots | b_j = \left\{\begin{array}{lr} a_1 & \text{if }j=k \\ 0 & \text{otherwise} \\ \end{array}\right\}\}$$

##### Transform
**Proficient -> ~Exemplary**
While I would love to work with some computational models in linear algebra, unfortunately I haven't gotten the chance to yet. The closest I've gotten to working with computation for linear algebra is creating a SymPy integration for my text editor which automatically evaluates Python and converts it to Latex. As for representing problems in multiple ways, I often represent problems at different levels of abstraction. While most of my proofs have an `Overview` section to help comprehension, I often create similar outlines during the process of approaching a problem to aid me in my problem solving process.

##### Strategy
**Proficient, ~Exemplary -> Exemplary**
Something that has been helpful recently is very explicitly traversing what my friends and I call the 'dependency tree' of results from the textbook. If I'm really stuck with a problem, then I start to employ some strategies that I use when competitive programming: creating different representations of the problem, looking for faulty assumptions, writing down related knowledge, etc.

##### Proof
**Proficient -> ~Exemplary**
I've been able to complete well fleshed out proofs in groups recently remarkably quickly compared to my proof skills at the beginning of the year. The only way to do this is by bouncing ideas off each other, determining their validity, and building off them. As for creating complete mathematical arguments supporting significant conjectures, I've mostly stuck to the problems provided. I don't know what qualifies as significant.


##### Application
**Proficient , ~Exemplary -> Exemplary**
I don't spend my free time looking for applications of linear algebra; instead, they find me! I had to use what I learned in linear algebra while working with Word Vectors for a project just the other day, and I had to work a lot with it during the Mathematical Modeling contest. Thus, while I apply linear algebra to real world situations, I don't look for applications myself -- however, it seems I don't need to.

##### Clarity and Articulation
**Proficient -> ~Exemplary?**
While for some of my proofs I struggled with length, when given the time, I think the proofs I can generate are quite clear. I take my audience into account by shaping the syntax, formatting, and content I use. I use overviews, more spacing with interspersed mathematical notation, and shorter sentences now. It's hard for me to tell how effective this is, but I think it's working alright.

##### Precision and Accuracy
**~Foundational, Proficient -> Proficient**
I struggled a bit with accuracy at the beginning of the year due to the unfamiliar nature of the problems, but I've improved a lot. I've started checking more rigorously for errors, and treating the finer granularity parts of problems with more importance. I think this shift shows in my recent proofs.

### Habits of Learning

##### Growth Mindset
**~Proficient + Exemplary -> Exemplary**
What has changed in the Growth Mindset category since midterms is my feedback progress. After presenting, I ask my peers for comments and feedback in the halls or at lunch. This feedback has helped a lot with my formatting and also structural organization, as well as picking up a lot of handy Latex tips and tricks.


##### Community
**Proficient, ~Exemplary -> Exemplary**
I've had a lot of fun working out problems with others recently. During my most recent group work with Taiga and Colin, I really felt the power of community -- every problem involved someone throwing something out there, and it getting built upon until we reached a solution. It felt like everyone had a different piece of the puzzle, which we used effectively. I also started and maintain the Linear Algebra Discord Server, which has grown quite a bit since midterms. We often have conversations about cool linear algebra concepts, and it's a cool place to find and share insights across different classes.

##### Reflection
**Proficient -> Exemplary?**
We haven't really had many reflection prompts from class. However, I always do a reflection after the readings, writing down more abstract ideas as well as what I felt like I needed to spend more time understanding. I also spend some of this time connecting up my different notes. For my in class notes, I often don't have time to organize them by concept and connect them in class, so I spend some time out of class doing this. For me, this process is quite reflective.

##### Academic Habits
**Exemplary -> Exemplary**
I felt really bad about not being able to get my proof done by Tuesday that one week with the Mathematical Modeling contest despite trying my very best to get all my work done. After the contest ended, I worked hard and generated what I think was a very nice proof, and also talked to Jana and Matt (sorry I don't know who's reading this) to get feedback for what to do in the future, as I really was trying my best and ran into some very bad luck.

My academic habits are a reflection of my interest, and I both care about learning linear algebra and find it fun. Thus, bar 3-hours-of-sleep-final-contest-sprint-Huxley, focusing hard during class isn't an issue and neither is turning in work.
