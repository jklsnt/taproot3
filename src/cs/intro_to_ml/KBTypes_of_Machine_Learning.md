### Types of ML
- Supervised
	- Linear regression
		- Good for predicting the outcome of independent variables
		- We are trying to find a line -- `y=mx+b`
		- What about with more features?
			- Just add dimensions
				- Not as visual, but math is the same 
		- Helps to relate variables
		- Not good for:
			- What type of tree is x based upon height and width?
			- Not a numeric output
			- Can't just assign numbers to words, as 0-1-2 is related to each other; say, model says its a combo of 1 and 2, comes out to a 1, which DOESN'T work. (idk why that auto capitalized)
		- Very fast and simple, which makes output easy to understand 
		- ==Assumes linear relation between incomes and outputs==
			- Important to visualize our data even after we run out model

				- These all have the same best fit line, the same x mean, y mean, x y standard dev, and a bunch more 
- Unsupervised
- Semi-Supervised


### Used for:
