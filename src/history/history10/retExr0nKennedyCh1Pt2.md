1. Facts
	1. Europe was decentralized because of geography and free trade -> no major tech gap
	2. Europe explored for profit and intended to stay, while the Chinese merely visited
	3. Europe developed superior technology, maybe because of a state of constant fear.
2. Claims
	1. Decentralized power allowed Europe to rise to the top
	2. Decentralized rule -> No monopoly -> Free trade -> arms race -> no major tech gap -> nobody can overpower everyone -> stay decentralized
	3. Arms race -> "political plurality"? and good navy
	4. Europe's gunships were the turning point
	5. expansion + trade increased knowledge and technology
3. Questions
	1. Why didn't other powers try to expand, esp. over seas?
	2. If clashing improves tech, why didn't Europe's improvements incentivise their attackers to improve?
