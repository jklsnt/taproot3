* India is very hard to rule in a very centralized way
	* Deccan plateu to the south 
		* Hard to conquer
		* Have to re-conquer because people did not respect his rule
	* Gangatic plain to the north
		* Easy to conquer
	* Rajputs
		* Small city-states with isolated rules
		* With independent principalities

And now, we are comparing palaces?

* Chende constructed to match people's religions
	* Instead of meeting people in the impressively Han seat of power, meet at a more relaxed place
	* Both asserted power in the main palace and appeased ethnicity in the summer palace
	
* Agra constructed to be a mix of religions
	* Instead of meeting people in the strictly Muslim seat of power, meet at a more.... fortified place
	* Both asserted power in to Tokata and appeased ethnicity in the summer palace
