Unit 3 Essay: 19th Century Transformations

Essay option 1: The political, economic, and technological transformations of the 19th century drastically changed the global power balance. In some cases, they made already strong states dramatically more powerful: witness Great Britain. In other cases, they paved the way for new, rising powers such as Japan, Germany, and Italy. And in still other cases, such as Egypt, India, China, Southeast Asia and Africa, they led to foreign intervention, imperialism and the loss of independence. What factor or factors most strongly determined which states would increase or decline in power in this time period (1815 to roughly 1900)? Answer this question with a thesis that addresses several, diverse examples from across the world. Tip: rather than accumulating a long, complex list of unrelated factors, simplify and pare down your thesis, saving the complexity for your examples.

Essay option 2:  According to Charles Tilly’s “bellicist” theory of state formation, states form to protect a territory from external threats. In the process of doing this (war-making), they develop the tools to eliminate internal rivals as well (state-making), and in order to fund these endeavours, they develop institutions like taxation to raise revenue from their territory (extraction). In order to maximize the wealth available for extraction and prevent property owners from needing private armies to protect themselves, the state establishes rule of law to protect property rights (protection). Insufficient state capacity in one of these domains is thus likely to affect the others. The 19th century is an especially interesting era in which to see this theory in action, as it witnesses the rise and fall of a number of new and old states. Using this theory as a starting point, compare and contrast state formation in two or three 19th century states we’ve studied this unit. You should have a thesis which points out a meaningful trend, disparity or hypothesis. 

Essay option 3: The post-1815 world was born from a massive ideological upheaval: The French Revolution and the subsequent spreading of liberal and nationalist ideals throughout an increasingly interconnected world. In the century to follow, nationalism and liberalism vied with each other as well as with other ideologies such as conservatism and socialism/communism. Blends of these existed as well. In an essay drawing upon specific examples from across the world, argue which of these ideologies was most transformative or important to understanding the events of the 19th century. Tip: the contrast between ideologies can help make your argument be more debatable and have more power-- show, for example, why liberalism had more of an impact than nationalism alone, or vice versa.

Note: Essays (either option) should cite from a wide variety of sources from the Unit 3 Reader. 

Other Submission guidelines: 3-4 pages, size 12 font, double-spaced. Citations should be in-line and formatted as (Authorname Pagenumber) i.e. (Kennedy 12). Include a Works Cited page in MLA format.

- interconnecitivty ran rampant
	- Prussian suc- cess was due in large measure to the application of new technologies to logistics and warfare: the new breech-loading “needle gun” (which could be fired from the prone position) and the use of the railroad and the tele- graph to move and coordinate troops and supplies. - mason 
	- he empi re was so widesp read that it was difficu lt for the power of the central government to radiate out throug h the provinces, even with the use of nineteenth· century technologies such as telegraphs and railroads. - gelvin 
	- The telegraph rapidly became as conventional a presence in the nineteenth century as the cell phone is today. And like other nineteenth century inventions -s teamboats and railroads and the Gatling gun - the telegraph proved to be an indispensable tool of imperialism - gelvin

	- started as closed off
		- In 1853, the American Commodore Perry forced his way with a fleet of naval vessels into Yedo Bay. insisted upon landing, and demanded of the Japanese government that it en gage in commercial relations with the United States and other Western powers. In the next year the Japanese began to comply, and in 1867 an internal revolution took place, of which the most conspicuous consequence was a rapid westernizing of Japanese life and institu tions. But if it looked as if the country had been “opened" by Westerners, actually Japan had exploded from within. - palmer 
		- For over two centuries Japan had followed a program of self-imposed isolation. No Japa nese was allowed to leave the islands or even to build a ship large enough to navigate the high seas. No foreigner, except for handfuls of Dutch and Chinese, was allowed to enter. Japan remained a sealed book to the West.  - palmer

- china resisted interconnevtivity
	- here were Confucian officials in the late nineteenth century who called for “self-strengthening,” learning from the West, and who began to build modern weapons, steamships, railroads and telegraph lines.

### Kinda wanna be more than friendsssss (unedited version) 


The Industrial Revolution gave birth to a massively shrinking world. It brought the invention of railroads, steamboats, and the telegraph, which "rapidly became as conventional a presence in the nineteenth century as the cell phone is today" (Gelvin 80). These inventions allowed for the rapid travel of goods and information the likes of which had never been seen before. The Industrial Revolution led to a sort of co-revolution which continues to this day: the interconnectivity revolution. Interconnectivity, in this context, can be defined as the exchange of goods and ideas and the infrastructure facilitating this exchange. All of a sudden, the world was becoming massively interconnected, not only dramatically increasing the pool of ideas that any given state had access to, but exponentially increasing the ways these ideas could interact with one another. As a consequence, the 19th century was fraught with massive changes in power. The major factor that determined which side of the power shift a state would be on was its willingness to embrace interconnectivity.

Britain heavily embraced interconnectivity, leveraging it for power and profit. Trade, one of Britain's main sources of income, is one of the primary manifestations of  interconnectivity. Britain heavily promoted trade, even leveraging its power to take territory from other states, creating "important commercial and trading centers" (Mason 98). They focused on developing a powerful navy, which became "the largest in the world" (Kennedy 152). This navy effectively served as an infrastructure for propagating interconnectivity, as seafaring was the primary means of transferring goods and ideas between states. They used this navy to enforce free trade and manage trade routes, further promoting interconnectivity and eventually leading to the "spectacular growth of an integrated global economy [...] and financial network centered [...] upon Great Britain" (Kennedy 143). Of course, Britain benefited massively off of this newly created integrated financial network, which, along with it's goods, would spread ideas. Expanding and rising in power immensely, Britain truly was one of the driving forces behind this interconnectivity revolution. 

After centuries of isolation, Japan accepted the interconnectivity revolution and prospered because of it. During Japan's period of self isolation, "no Japanese was allowed to leave the islands or even to build a ship large enough to navigate the high seas. No foreigner [...] was allowed to enter" (Palmer 543). Japan had little power, little influence, and was the antithesis of an interconnected state. This isolation continued until 1853, when "the American Commodore Perry forced his way with a fleet of naval vessels into Yedo Bay," initiating Japan into the interconnectivity revolution (Palmer 543). Commodore Perry demanded that the Japanese engage in trade with the Western powers, and "the Japanese began to comply [...] in 1867 an internal revolution took place, of which the most conspicuous consequence was a rapid westernizing of Japanese life and institutions" (Palmer 543). In what is now called the Meiji era, spanning from 1868 to 1912, Japan experienced a complete shift from isolation to being the model of a modern state. Trade, "almost literally zero in 1854, was valued at $200 million a year by the end of the century" (Palmer 548). Japan embraced interconnectivity, exchanging and adopting ideas along with goods. This exchange led to a massive increase in Japan's power, and they formed a "newly westernized army and navy" which was "modeled on the British" (Palmer 547). This increase in power allowed Japan to defeat the Russians and the Chinese, much "to the world's amazement" (Palmer 654). Japan, beginning as the very opposite of an interconnected state, accepted interconnectivity, and rapidly gained the ideas and goods which ultimately led to a massive increase in their power. 

China, starting with isolation similar to Japan’s, resisted the interconnectivity revolution and suffered because of it. Initially, China resisted free trade. They saw trade itself as a sort of charity, a privilege "granted to less-developed 'barbarians' in exchange for their paying respects to the Son of Heaven and his court" (Ropp 102). They also heavily restricted trade, allowing it only in specific ports and confining traders to but "a few warehouses [...] to reside only temporarily to load and unload their ships." (Ropp 102). This outlook on trade — and the policy that followed — led to the inevitable and increasing frustration of the British traders. Not only did China resist the exchange of goods, but they also resisted the exchange of ideas — two key components in interconnectivity. In 1898, "a brilliant Confucian scholar who admired Japan for its rapid adoption of Western institutions and industrialization" tried to do the same to China (Ropp 110). He issued a myriad of edicts, all based upon the idea of sending China through a "crash program of industrialization and Westernization" (Ropp 110). Conservatives grew alarmed, and the reform movement was easily and soundly crushed. Interconnectivity inherently brings with it a loss in autonomy and tradition, and China's unwillingness to sacrifice these led to it's downfall. Of course, Britain eventually released their navy upon China. Unlike the Japanese who embraced the interconnectivity revolution and built a powerful military, "the Chinese had no naval forces" and were almost instantly defeated (Ropp 105). The British mandated free trade by force, and China massively decreased in power. China was now an unwilling part of the interconnectivity revolution.



Not only does interconnectivity allows for broader access to ideas and goods, but it allows for new ideas to be created that would otherwise be impossible. The power of the interconnectivity revolution was greater than any state, and acceptance of this historical trend was required for success. The interconnectivity revolution has only continued, the world still shrinking day by day. In modern times — with the invention of the internet and such — it is much easier to see the value of interconnectivity, making refuting its importance almost futile. Sometimes we must sacrifice in the face of global trends 





interconnectivity is more important and evident in modern day
