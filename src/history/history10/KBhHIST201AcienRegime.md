# Acien Régime
The Old France was economy generally rural + dominated by subsistence farming.

## Societal Structure
 Strict grid of social hierarchy resulted due to birthright => Great Chain of Being
 
**Great Chain of Being**
The entire "world" was, according to GCB, organized structurally with god at the top, rocks at the bottom. 

In the human world, King on the top — God's divine representative ("L'état c'est moi" — the state is me), then the clergy, then aristocracy, and finally commoners.

In practice, this makes a...

## Estates: "Caste" System

French societies organized into three castes — "estates". Old France very Roman Catholic with the Church owning a large amount of resources => almost 10% w/ the monarchs crowed in cathedrals.

* **First Estate** => clergy; enjoyed high status
* **Second Estate** => aristocracy; provided military and monetary support
	* *Les Grands*: largest landholders w/ large houses
	* *Seigneurs*: provincial nobles who simply owned estates in the countryside
* **Third Estate** => 97% of the population
	* Production!
	* Reproduction!
	* Work!
	* Relatively prosperous, but <40% owned land
	* Most rented land from lords as tenant farmers/sharecroppers

	
## Infrastructure Disorganization
* No national currency, nor system of weights and measures, nor a market
* Network of highways existed, but not very efficient

## Merchanitilist Economy
* Economic policy guided by **merchanitilist theory**
	* Notion that precious metals holdings is the ultimate goal
	* Encouraged development of manufacturing to provide for global market
	* Development of the new *bourgeoisie* class — small merchants and shopkeepers
	
## Need of Reform	
The established merchantilist theory came under challenge by newer philosophies like the free market theory.

* **Adam Smith**'s free market economy/baurseiosie challenged mercantilistic economy
