# The Ottomans' Successes in the 1500s

**3 main factors of growth**

* Original leader was quite shrewd
* Strategic link between Europe + Asia at the Daranelles strait
* Creation of army combining Trukish techniques + high tech gunpowder

* Eastern frontier => where Safavid was
* Southern frontier => red sea 

## The Early Rise

The country started with a mix of three cultures

* Turkish Nomads
* Muslim Warriors
* Christian Converts

In 1453, Constantinople was conquered by the Ottomans, which ended Byzantine rule + gave a pretty good capital


## The Ottomans' Battlings
* Conquered Safavid Empire => 1514
* Seized Damascus in the year 1516
* Conqured Egypt 1517
* Worked around, and all the way to the Black Sea — attacking Arabia along the way
* Overran Hungary (although, Northern Hungary was kept, and so was the HRE) the same year
* Seeked control of the Mediterranean
* (Unsuccessfullyl) tried to fight Venice
    * Initial fight => reduced millitary power + tribunage
    * Finally fell another century later, but due to unrelated reasons
* Fought the Porchugueses, too!
    * Tried to deter porchuguese threats
    * Successfully prevented them from closing in, but ultimately did not conquer into Porchigual
