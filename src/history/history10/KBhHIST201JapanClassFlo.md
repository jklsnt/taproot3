	- Shogunate moves to westernize
	- Shougun precieved as weak and so there was a rebel
- Sonno Joi — "Revere the Emperor, Expel the Barbarians" => lead by the warlords farest away
- 1868: Meiji Restoration
	- Westernization takes place
	- Sakamoto Reoma
		- On his way to assasinate the Shougun, he was convinced that Westernization is a good solution
		- The rebels becoming convinced, and started hijacking the forces
