* When sudden enforcement of trade occured, the British felt like it was an insult to the British crown and proceeded to wage war against the navally-weak China.
* After loosing the opionum war, the Qing court had to agree to a series of supplicating agreements that ended with hurtful consiquences and CLAIM without realizing destroyed the foreign policies of China.

## Beginnings of Unrest
* The Taiping Movement
	* Taiping movement threatened the Qing government’s (a.k.a. British) trading of opium, but supported the spead of Christianity (albeit the flavor where the emperor is Jesus’ yonger brother.)
	* Power struggle in the Taiping regieme lead to internal collapse a few years later.
	* Manchu weakness forced them to give the Chinese-Chinese army more power to quell the movement
	
**In 1858, Anglo-French forces invaded Beijing, storming the summer palace, took over the Chinese tax system, and eventually basically established the Qing rule as a colony of the west.**

**China vs. Imperialism**

The Dynastic Cycle...

1. New Empire
	* Peace
	* Order
2. Old Empire
	* Corruption
	* Incompetence
	* Downfaall
3. Conflict
	* Natural Disasters
	* Invasions

Repeat!

The British acquired a large amount of tea, silk, and vermillion from China, but imported basically only Opium.

* Opium => unproductivity
	* Weakened the productivity of China
	* Offset the trade deficit with Britian

**Opium is technically illegal**, so the whole operation is largely smuggling.

**Taiping Rebellion**

	- Took a large part of the country
	- Got control of a large part of grain and wheat production
- 洪秀全 — Taiping Rebellion
	- Thinks that he is Jesus' old brother
		- Had a fever dream of visiting "father"
		- After hearing about Christian philosophy, ret-cons the dream into 
	- Is a failed scholar who did not work for the government
	- Harnessed peasant discontent + cut South China away
- To rapidly quell the Taiping rebellion...
	- Granted more army and power to the provincial government
	- Decentralized control, which caused problems down the line
