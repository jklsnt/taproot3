# deRichelieu's Raison de Etat

## Background
* Near-death of HRE would allow France to expand eastwards
* Needed a way of fending off the ever-growing HRE

So, in comes...

## Cardinal de Richelieu
"Father of the modern state system."

Proposed and practiced [[KBhHIST201RaisonDeEtat]] in France

* Richelieu is secular as minister, while salvation is only a personal objective => conflict with [[KBhHIST201HolyRomanEmpire1500s]] Ferdinand's beliefs 
* "The state has no immorality" => acting on the state means acting either now or never
* CLAIM @[[KBhHIST201Kissinger]] — HRE would have expanded more if they agreed to work with the protestants who were totally fine with HRE dominating politically 

### Acts of Raison de 'Etat
Richeliu Subsidized the protestant German fight against the [[KBhHIST201HolyRomanEmpire1500s]] for it was in the French national interest evens against his religion.

Unique and novel secular support of a given that he himself is Catholic.
