```
Please reflect on your learning this past semester in the following areas.  Write a few sentences for each question (#1-3).  You don’t have to answer all the sub-questions; they are just suggestions.  Please answer in English.
```

1) Highlights

One highlight was the oral exam — not the exam itself, but the process of studying for the exam. While incredibly stressful and a massive amount of work, it felt good to finally be able to put everything we have learned this semester to use. 


2) Challenges

Some of the early listening quizzes were quite challenging for me, as the audio was not nearly as clear as in person. I was also just getting used to the whole quarantine schooling situation, which is much different than last year.


3) Goals

My goals were to try to become more 'fluent,' in the sense that the barrier between meaning and sentence in Japanese is reduced. I definitely do feel that I have reduced this barrier quite a bit. In the next semester, I seek to continue to reduce this barrier. 


4) Do you have any other questions, comments, or requests for me?

Despite the constant barrage of apocalypses (apocali?), it has been a wonderful semester of Japanese!
