###  莲花清瘟, Lianhuaqingwen

- published more recently


Ingredients (NOT SURE):
forsythia, honeysuckle, almond, banlangen, cordate houttuynia, ageratum, pieplant, rhodiola root, menthol, liquorice

bottom line:
Seems that people agree that it helps treat symptoms, but it has not been verified as a medicine specifically for treating covid. 
It seems that it is safe, and won't do harm.


## flo on [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXY6QUdMSIY)

- lots of data collection from a covid symptom tracker app
	- data is skewed towards older and white (~54yo)

- being female is a risk factor for long covid
	- ive seen this elsewhere as well
- weak associations with BMI and age
- however, things change over 70:
	- note: not nearly as many data points here
	- positive association with male, 
	- diabetes became much more significant
	
- related symptoms prior:
	- most important: number of symptoms
		- so lets track them! 
	- general health status, ofc
	- and then classical covid symptoms
	
-  "limited activity" seems to be a risk factor. this is classified as those who "have a condition that limites physical activity"
- nothing from the above on children, as selected for only adults.

***

- long covid can manifest as changes in allergies? can develop strong new allergies after having covid
	- aka. covid leads to broader levels of programatic changes within the immune system
- 

![[Pasted image 20220710225102.png||500]]

- long covid symptoms co-occur more as time increases
- long covid symptoms are seen 1.5x more often after covid vs. influenza
	- #cool not nearly as much as I would have expected.
-
