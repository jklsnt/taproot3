## new plan! but with STERIODS! (aka alb :p)
- no more sorting into blocks!
- instead, we:
	- find the bounding box, and render a thing
	- render transclusions as instances of the book at the right location
	- stuff on the sides?
	- need INF SCROLL!


init the height as looking backwards when it gets rendered with a func




- pagewise bounding boxes which act as ANNOTATIONS and are ABSOLUTELY positioned
