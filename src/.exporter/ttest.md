# Title of the Document

This is some text, beginning our document. This is an assignment. I am, very, tired.

Chicken? *Chicken.* **Chicken!**

| just | table | tingz |
| ---- | ----- | ----- |
| a    | b     | c     |

The above `table` still needs some work.


### A Subsection

We have a subsection, and in the subsection, we have some code!

```py
def does_it_halt(program):
	return True

# les meander.
```


- also, of course.
- we need a
		- bulleted
		- list
			- with indents that go up
	- and indents that go down
		- which is deeply nested,
			- pretty regardless
				- and quirky
- does this work?


We also have $\LaTeX$
$$
\frac{x^{2}}{4} + \frac{\sin^{5}{\left(x \right)}}{5} - \frac{2 \sin^{3}{\left(x \right)}}{3} + \sin{\left(x \right)}
$$
and also, $\textrm{inline latex which works like this with}\ \theta_x$ and stuff


### Another Section

- With a lightly nested list
- Because I do a lot of things like this
	- This being a lightly nested list
	
- Where most things are on the original row
- But sometimes
	- We something nested like this

The word, **important!**

pre cool, right?
