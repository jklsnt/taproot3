* Axler6.45 orthogonal complement, $U^\bot$                             :def:
  #+begin_quote
  if $U$ is a subset of $V$, then the orthogonal complement of $U$, denoted $U^\bot$, is the set of all vectors in $V$ that are orthogonal to every vector in $U$:

  \[\begin{aligned}
  U^\bot = \{ v \in V : \langle v, u \rangle = 0 \forall u \in  U \}
  \end{aligned}\]

** results
*** Axler6.46 basic properties
**** complement is a subspace: if $U$ is a subset of $V$, then $U^\bot$ is a subspace of $V$
***** zero is orthogonal to each vector, any vector that is the sum of two fully orthogonal vectors or the scalar multiple of an orthogonal vector will still be fully orthogonal.
**** $\{0\}^\bot = V$
***** zero orthogonal to every vector
**** $V ^\bot = \{0\}$
***** only zero orthogonal to every vector
**** If $U$ is a subset of $V$, then $U \cap U^\bot\subseteq \{0\}$
***** only zero is orthogonal to itself
**** If $U$ and $W$ are subsets of $V$ and $U\subseteq W$ then $W^\bot \subseteq U^\bot$
***** Everything in $W^\bot$ is in $U^\bot$, and more.
*** Axler6.47 direct sum of a subspace and its orthogonal complement
	#+begin_quote
	Suppose $U$ is a finite-dimensional subspace of $V$. Then,
	\[\begin{aligned}
    V = U \oplus U^\bot
	\end{aligned}\]
	#+end_quote
	This can be shown by seeing that splitting any vector in $V$ into a $U$ part and a non-$U$ part leads to the non-$U$ being in $U^\bot$
*** Axler6.50 dimension of orthogonal complement
	#+begin_quote
	Suppose $V$ is finite-dimensional and $U$ is a subpsace of $V$. Then,

	\[\begin{aligned}
    \odim $U^\bot$ = $\odim V - \odim U$
	\end{aligned}\]
	#+end_quote
	By the dimension of a subspace addition (Axler3.78)

*** Axler6.51 orthogonal complement of orthogonal complement is itself
	#+begin_quote
	Suppose $U$ is a finite-dimensional subspace of $V$. Then
	\[\begin{aligned}
    U = (U^\bot) ^\bot
	\end{aligned}\]
	#+end_quote
	Because $U \oplus U^\bot = V$ is a direct sum and equals $V$.

	The actual proof is by double-inclusion.
