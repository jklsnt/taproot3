# Organizing Organelles Based on Membranes

By organizing [[KBhBIO101EukaryoticOrganells]] based on whether or not they have membranes, it helps us gauge the evolutionary history of cells.

## Membranous Organelles
These have membranes! They have their own plasma, regulates their own macromolecule consumption, hormones, etc. Based on [[KBhBIO101Endosymbiotic]] endosymbiotic theory, double-memranous organelles may perhaps be the organelles that were originally independent prokaryotic cells that evolve to coexist with Eukarotes; by the same token, single-membraneous organelles may be fragements of prokaryotic cells.

### Double Membranes
* Mitochrondria => store ATP and extract energy from ATP
* Chloroplasts => Does photosynthesis

### Double Membranes, Evolved Later
*  Endoplasmic reticulum => forms the network of transferring proteins and other elements
*  Golgi body/Gioli apparatus => packs, sorts, and modifies proteins and other elements throughout the cell

### Single Membranes
* Vesticles
* Lysomoes => breaking stuff down and garbage dumps 
* Vacuoles => storing water, nutrients, waste

## Non-Membranous Organells
These organelles does not process their own plasma, and they are mostly part of the cytoskeleton of a cell.

* Ribosomes => protein synthesizer in the cell
* Centrosome => forms flangella, cilla, and handles cells divisions
* Plastids => creates colours displayed in the chromoplasts
