So, let's begin with a very easy concept (sarcasm)

# What is life?
**When is someone dead?**

> This is hard, so let's instead think about what a child?

Biological Female + Sperm + relative safety + Lot's of Peanut Butter => Child.

But! We know that:

* The person does not consciously go "let's create a liver", for instance
* Instead… She is following **self organization rules**
    * Pieces self organize
    * Put some chemistry into some matter, and it will organize to create a human being
* Theses **self organization rules**…
    * Does not need to be taught
    * Is inate to system
    * Is on both the micro and macro level
        * Micro => Cells functioning
        * Macro => Flock of birds

## Self Organization Rules
Simple structures causes intricate, complicated behavior.

See [[KBhBIO101SelfOrganization]], self-organization.

## Types of Biology
* Translational
* Academic
* Textbook
* Education

### Textbook Biology
* Journaled and formalized
* "Sum total of bio knowledge"

### Academic Biology
* Scientific pursue of information
* Synthesis and discovery of information

### Translational Biology
* Research with outcome in mine
* Trying to solve "a problem"

### Educational Biology
* Sharing and communicating biology
* Luke De :heart: Edu Biology 
* Like…
    * Convincing people to have vaccines
    * Convincing mask wearing

Think: **how would I share this information**
