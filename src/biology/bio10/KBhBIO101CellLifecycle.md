# The Cell('s) (Life)Cycle
## So, why do cell divide
Everyday, 50-70 Billion die (**programmed cell death**, apoptosis), so...

> The ability to produce organisms more of their kind is one characteristic that best distinguishes living things from nonliving matter

[[KBhBIO101Viruses]] and organelles challenge this definition => they are symbiotic and cannot reproduce on their own. But like screw them right?

To compensate for programmed cell death, (cell division) happen. 

**Before we continue, do yourself a favor and review [[KBhBIO101DNAStructures]]**	

## So, when do cells divide? (The Actual Cell Cycle)
The cell follows a lifecycle from new cell to cell-too-bit-aaa-gotta-divide called... you ready for this? "Cell Cycle". At the pointy bit of the cell cycle, the cell reproduces [[KBhBIO101CellReproduction]]. And et viola the cell cycle!
