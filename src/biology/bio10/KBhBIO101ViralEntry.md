# Viral Entry
This is the process by which viruses, haven been stuck to the surface of its host cell by [[KBhBIO101ViralAttachment]], enter the cell. There are three main mechanisms by which this happens...

## Direct Injection/insertion
- Insert genome through the bi-layer
- Leave the rest behind

## Endocytosis
- Trick the host cell into introducing the virus as food
- Endocytosis!
- Bam

## Fusion
 - Virus fuse with cell membrane
 - Shed the protein coat once in
 - Shazam!
