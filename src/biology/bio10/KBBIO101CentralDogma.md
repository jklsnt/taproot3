# Central Dogma
 - The central dogma says that protein instructions are found in DNA
	 - RNA carries these instructions somewhere which manufactures proteins
	 - Parts of DNA are transcribed into RNA
 - In short DNA  -- > RNA -- > Protein
	 - This is done because moving DNA doesn't make sense as it's the master copy
	 - RNA is moved to the place that the protein can be made from the instructions
 - This is done through transcription and translation
	 - Notes on that can be found here [[KBBIO101TranscriptionTranslation]]
 - DNA and RNA are very close aside from Uracil and Thymine
	 - Both of the codes are formed by patterns of charges
