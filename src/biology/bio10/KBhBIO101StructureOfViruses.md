# Structure of Viruses
* **All contain**
	* Capsid => structural protein coat
	* Genome => RNA/DNA; but not both
* **Some contain**
	* Membraneous-enclosed capsid => envelope
	* Externally-facisg host-cell fusion proteins => spikes
	* Viral genome replication enzymes => prlymerases
	* Other proteins for fun => enzymes, motor proteins, transcription factors, host-cell interacting proteins, etc.
