# Emergent Properties
 - An emergent property is a property within a unit that creates a structure when coupled with other units with similar properties.i
     - This self-organization based on a property or set of properties is called an emergent property.

## Bird Example
 - Bird's flying in a V is a great example of what an emergent property is.
     - This is because it demonstrates a multi-level organization system.


## Measure by proxy
 - has potential for error
 - when you try to quantify a concept, the definition will change
