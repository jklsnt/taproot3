# Overview
- Rubisco is apparently a cool protein
- Most abundant protein in the world
- Enzyme that is very slow, which is why plants make so much of it
- Rubisco in [pop science](https://pdb101.rcsb.org/motm/11)

# Carbon Fixation
- Turning carbon from the air into carbohydrates
- Combines carbon from $CO_2$, light, and water to get carbohydrates
	- $6CO_2 + 6H_2O + light = \text{carbs}$
# Faults
- Rubisco sometimes accidentally binds oxygen to a sugar chain in a process called photorespiration
	- The cell actually has to expend more energy to fix this mistake
- Also it's like really really slow, processing around 3 reactions per second instead of other enzymes which often process thousands
