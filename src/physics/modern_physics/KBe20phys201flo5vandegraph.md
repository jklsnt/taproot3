corona discharge from a sharp point
- charges ground off a point easier than 

current = which way and how much
- low current high voltage is fine
- hot dogs in a microwave (poke holes)
- current kills not voltage

## Vandegraph demo
- See annotated pdf last page [[SRCelectrostaticsPacket1annotatedExr0n.pdf]]
- #question How does the comb keep depositing charge onto the rubber belt?
	- something about glass creates static charge with rubber, minuses on the inside inducing dipole in rubber atoms (atoms rotate) and pluses on outside? Which attracts more charge from the ground?
	- Spark is a plasma
		- Electrons and atoms are ripped from each other, and the charged particles are free to move wherever they want (~ 10k volts per centimeter)
