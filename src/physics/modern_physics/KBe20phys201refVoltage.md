# Voltage
- Units: $\frac{Nm}{C} = \frac{J/C} = V$
- Amount of energy per unit of charge it takes to bring that charge to that point
	- If you have a ball and you are taking it up the hill, then it takes energy to do that
	- When you let go, it will roll back down the hill
	- Voltage = energy per charge is similar to energy per kilogram of raising the ball.
	- Field is the amount that it is resisting--the amount of force required to move the charge.
	- **Analogous to gravitational potential energy**.

## Zero Point
- If you have one positive and one negative, then the zero point of the voltage is between the two charges
- The zero can be defined anywhere, just like zero gravitational energy can be anywhere
	- However, conventionally, we define zero to be between two opposite charges
	- We also define the voltage infinity distance away to be zero

## Equipotential
- A line that shows where voltage is the same

- Joules of electric potential energy
- Scalar, while electric field is a vector
### Relationship with Electric Field
- Perpendicular to the electric field
