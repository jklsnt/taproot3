# Page o' notes

### Machine learning broad level implications on privacy

- ML requires big data
	- machine learning has driven us into the "information age"
		- cause of most of these issues
	- getting lots of info -> invading privacy, generally
	
- ML can break privacy without explicit data
	- ML can de-anonymize anonymous activities
		- ML based tracking systems make anonymity hard
		- hashing ISN'T good enough
	- same thing can be done even without ml
		- location tracking easily de-anonymized by simple cross reference
		
- ML can construct human models
	- fundamentally about simulation intelligent behavior
	- ML model of how you think and act
		- viewed as creepy
	- if it could predict your thoughts, what then?

### Regulation!

- FTC (federal trade commission) coming down hard
	- hitting Facebook, google, ect.
- CCPA, California consumer privacy act
- GDPR, General Data Protection Regulation
- how effective is regulation? 
	- can we really prevent it?
	- one of the arguments: 
	> "if you make data collection illegal, only criminals will have the data"

### Rights

- right to be forgotten
	- opt out law by the consumer
	- is this a right?
	
- right to our data, as outlined in CCPA
	- again, really a right?
	
- individualize experience moral?
	- amazon adjusting prices,
	- insurance companies not accepting 
	- ect. 

- private company rights to charge how they please?
	- **libertarian args go here**

### Flipside

- if privacy-preserving techniques ultimately fail, 
	- then what?
	
- ML does a lot of good
	- though the individual might not want to share medical data,
	- that same data on the large scale could save countless lives

- garbage in, garbage out + black box
	- not. good. 
	- especially when AI will dominate decision making and analysis.

- forced to give data by tragedy of the commons
	- you want ml networks to portray your demographic accurately,
	- and if you don't give data, it won't. In a world dominated by ml,
	- giving your data becomes necessity

- forced to give data by economic necessity
	- where data collection is truly opt out, services replace it with paid
	- economically worse off will be more likely to give data
	- skews data collected?

## Reflec

1) **What is the ethical issue/debate/controversy in question? In other words, how does the topic relate to the question of how we should live with science and technology?**
Should abortion be legal? How do we think about start of life with improving technology?

2) **Describe at least two different perspectives on the issue (these could be complementary or opposing).**
Abortion is murder, it shoudn't be legal.
People have a right to their own body.

3) **What seems to be at stake (e.g, philosophically, politically, or intellectually)?**
Abortion laws!
