# Notes
### Do most people believe in it?
 - There are still scientists that are divided about the issue of climate change, but they are few and far between
	 - The Majority of Americans think that scientists **are** divided about climate change
 - Only a little more than half of Americans think that global temperatures have risen
	 - This is concerning since it is not really a concept that is under heavy scientific debate


### Are we Sure it's Real?
 - Could we be wrong on climate change? We've been wrong in the past even when almost the entire scientific community has a general consensus
	 - Before the twentieth century it was much easier to publish less supported conclusions
		 - The scientific process in general has gotten stricter and more accurate
 - In the case of climate science since political action is required, there has been an unusual effort to make new scientific discovery about this subject accessible to everyone and not just experts
 - Scientists predicted a long time ago that greenhouse gas emissions could change the climate and there is now overwhelming evidence that the climate is changing
 
 
 ### Why is there Uncertainty In the General Public
  - Political uncertainty is different from scientific uncertainty
	  - A lot of people may be uninformed for this reason
  - Sometimes it is hard to make a distinction between uncertainty in future events based upon current scientific understanding and understanding in the current situation
  - A lot of scientists see their jobs as knowledge finders/creators and not communicators of this knowledge
	  - Some even sneer at those who are trying to communicate the consensus calling them populerizers(I give up on spelling).
 
 
 ### What now
  - While no scientific conclusion is provable, our current understanding is our best and relatively strong
	  - It is therefore the most logical to take action on
	  - However, there is no one measurement of scientific reliability
 
## C Plus Plus that Reflects my Current Feelings on this

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
	std::cout << "Why does isos post readings so late :(" << std::endl;
}
```

The above code is written in C++ and has been scientifically proven to be better than it's C# equivalent. This has caused uncertainty about the future of climate simulations and in extension the future of our lives as most simulation type technologies are written in C#.
