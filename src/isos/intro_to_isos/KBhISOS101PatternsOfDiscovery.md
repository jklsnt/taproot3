# Patterns of Discovery

Importance lies in how _observed_ data affects _interpreted_ data.

* Two people may see the same thing, but they interprete wildly different results
* Different means and systems of thinking affect data molding and interpretation

Seeing => usually implies both the photochemical reaction and the interpretation thereof, but difference usually not appreciated.

- Process between viewing and interpretation not often appreciated
- People cannot see without interpreting — *"one simply does not soak up an optical patter and then clamp an interpretation on it."*

Existence of two perspectives possible (_duh_) even when presented to the same image.

## Interpretation is hard and faulty
* Knowledge of whats illustrated is needed to have illustration be communicated
* Explanation and knowledge affects or induces interpretation
* One could be "blind" to a geometric image if background knowledge not introduced

Seeing: *observation of x … shaped by prior knowledge of x*.
