* Silicon
** refirenry
*** from sand
*** melted
*** small molten crystal "seed" lower into a vat
*** crystal forms
*** pull cylander from molten reigon
*** ground to form ingots
*** sawed with diamond blade to form wafers
*** wafer scrubbed
*** edges rounded and surfaces ground smooth and to create uniform thickness
*** rinsed and etched in "chemicals" to remove impurities
*** final polish on one side of the wafer
*** all so that there are no scratches or contamination
*** then, measured for resistivity
**** function of dopant concentratian
*** electron beam machine
**** etches patterns onto chrome plated glass plates in clean room
*** glass plates become masks used to transfer the circuit pattern onto the wafer
*** usage of masks
**** first mask creates divots
**** masks 4, 5 define source and drain reigons
**** mask 6 defines contact holes to allow aluminium to be inserted
**** mostly use 12-25 masks depending on complexity and type of circuit (much more now)
*** decontamination
**** bunny suits
**** very high purity materials
*** fabrication techniques (4)
**** formation of thin layers of silicon dioxidn
**** introduction of dopants
**** deposition of thin layers of conducting/insulating materials
**** something?
*** cleaning
**** hot acids to clean wafers, repeated throughout process
**** rinsed in deionized water and spun dry in filtered nitrogen gas
**** grow layer of silicon dioxide in a vertical furnace
***** protects silicon substrate benieth from unwanted reactions
****** pure oxygen used to grow silicon dioxide
**** etch stencil to silicon dioxide using photolithography
**** photoresist coated on wafers, then solvents inside the solution is evaporated
***** negative resist hardens when exposed
***** positive resist changes and is removed when developed
****** that's what is used in this run
**** computer controlled machine called stepper
***** wafer positioned under selected mask pattern
***** ultraviolet light projected onto photoresist
**** etching
***** wet etching can be bad
****** can undercut photoresist
***** dry (plasma) etching
****** use plasma to react away exposed silicon dioxide
**** removal of photoresist
***** acid baths?
***** hot oxygen?
**** same thing repeated with each mask
*** ion implanter
**** bombard with ions to implant dopants
***** ions accelerated using magnetic fields
***** etched silicon dioxide only allows ions on some areas
***** embed opposite ions that are later diffused into the well to become transistors
*** deposition furnace
**** deposits something resistive to protect?
*** second mask
**** used to define actual transistor reigons
**** wafers devolped to remove exposed photoresist
**** then plasma etched to remove free flourine
**** then photoresist removed
**** wafers in oxidization furnace
**** thick insulating layer of sicilon dioxide grown over where previous was etched
**** called field oxide
*** uniform electrical dioxide regrown?
**** gate electrons formed by depositing polysilicon
***** many small grains of silicon doped with phospherus
**** photolithography and next mask to etch gate electrodes
**** distance controlled carefully because it affects final speed of transistor
*** more masks used with photoresist and cleaning to grower further complexity
*** annealing
**** ion implantation defects repaired
*** thick glass layer
**** insulates all pieces
*** glass surface planarized
**** using chemical and mechanical processes
**** chemical mechanical planalization (CMP) not used much anymore
*** mask 6: define contact holes for metal wiring
*** plasma etching again to create contact holes
**** looks like small dots under microscope
**** must be filled with metal plug to ensure solid elecric connection (tungsten)
*** metal etcher polishes away extra tungsten
** design
*** circuit design
*** organization of design team
**** based on organization of the chip
**** establish microarchitecture that regulates sequences and timings
**** design divided into areas
***** each unit given to logic designer
***** each functional block given to circuit designer who works at transistor level
**** mask designer draws out blueprints on paper
*** transistors
**** represents digital zero or one
**** C-MOS transistors
***** complementary metal oxidized transistor
***** n type transistor
****** surrounded by n-type
****** sandwhiching a p-type layer
****** gate electrode is near but not connect to the p type reigon
****** a positive charge in gate attracts electrons and allows electrons to pass
***** both types can be made on the same chip using "complementary manufacturing?"
***** signals propogate through complex maze of switches
** structure
*** cubic atomic structure
*** 4 electrons valence shell
*** perfect crystal will have no holes
*** but at room temperature, free electrons can conduct
** impurities called dopants
*** negative
**** arsenic or phospherus
**** one more valence
**** n type crystal because negative free carriers
*** positive
**** boron
**** missing electron acts like positive carrier, "hole"
*** silicon can be either good or poor conductor (semiconductor)
**** controlled by concentration of dopant
